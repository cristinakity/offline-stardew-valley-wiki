They often provide information related to <a href="Category_Gameplay.html" title="Category:Gameplay">gameplay</a>.
</p><p>At the game's start, the Library has only a single title in its shelves: "Tips on Farming" (found below with the list of lost books). The other books are always found in the order in which they are listed in the following table.

<p>Diamonds seem to only form at mine level 50 or greater. At level 50, approximately 1 in 500 stones will be diamond-rich.

<p>Another mystery of the dwarves is the advanced technology they supposedly possess. Evidence such as this had led me, despite the ridicule of my colleagues, to propose a new theory:
</p><p>I believe the dwarves are the remnants of a once advanced civilization whos interplanetary vehicle crashed on this planet long ago.
</p><p>I propose that this dwarvish spaceship bore down, deep underground... and over time, the dwarves became adapted to their new underground environment.
</p><p>My colleagues ask, 'Why didn't they come above ground and live on the surface?' ...Perhaps their old planet had a thicker atmosphere that protected them from stellar radiation, and they simply could not survive in our sunlight.
</p><p>That would explain why they only surface at night to take what they need from our houses...

<td>Tex: Gordy, tell me your best fisherman's story.
<p>Gordy: -deep sigh-... I've caught a lot of big fish in my time... And some that are very rare and difficult... But there was one that I struggled to catch for three days and three nights.
</p><p>Gordy: I call this fish... 'The <a href="Legend.html" title="Legend">Legend</a>'. He was a huge beast... And the harder I tugged on the line, the harder he tugged back. I let my guard down for a moment and he snapped my boat in two. I've never fished since.
</p><p>Tex: Do you think anyone will ever catch him?
</p><p>Gordy: Hmm... If this person were a master at fishing, and caught all other rare fish first, and made sure they ate the correct kind of food... then maybe. Above all you've got to have respect for the water, son.
</p><p>Tex: ...son? Do you mean... you're... f...father?
</p><p>Gordy: Yes, my boy.

<td>The blueprints for an advanced piece of machinery called a '<a href="Crystalarium.html" title="Crystalarium">Crystalarium</a>' have recently been published.
<p>This machine can grow crystals from almost nothing, providing their owners with endless supplies of valuable gems!
</p><p>Here's how it works: Place a gem of your choice inside the crystalarium...
now be patient, it can take up to several days... but eventually the crystalarium will grow a copy of whatever you placed inside!
You'll know it's ready when it stops wiggling. Once you remove your gem the crystalarium will start working on yet another clone... You'll never need to restock it unless you want to change the kind of gem it produces!
</p><p>Unfortunately, the crystalarium doesn't work with the extremely rare gemstone known as '<a href="Prismatic_Shard.html" title="Prismatic Shard">Prismatic Shard</a>'... For some reason, the EMF from the shard interacts negatively with the crystalarium.

<p>The <a href="Crimsonfish.html" title="Crimsonfish">Crimsonfish</a> lives in the warm ocean waters of <a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a>. It's been sighted on the <a href="The_Beach.html#Tide_Pools" title="The Beach">far eastern side</a> of <a href="The_Beach.html" title="The Beach">the beach</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="Glacierfish.html" title="Glacierfish">Glacierfish</a>, which only appears in <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a>, can be caught off the southern tip of arrowhead island in <a href="Cindersap_Forest.html" title="Cindersap Forest">Cindersap Forest</a>... near where the river meets the ocean.
</p><p>The <a href="Angler.html" title="Angler">Anglerfish</a> has been spotted in <a href="Fall.html" title="Fall">fall</a>, north of <a href="Pelican_Town.html" title="Pelican Town">town</a> where the river flows down from the mountains.
</p><p>There's rumor of a <a href="Mutant_Carp.html" title="Mutant Carp">strange, twisted fish</a> that lives in the <a href="The_Sewers.html" title="The Sewers">sewer</a>.
</p><p>The final fish, of a species never before caught, is known simply as '<a href="Legend.html" title="Legend">Legend</a>'. It is rumored that he lives in a log submerged in the <a href="The_Mountain.html" title="The Mountain">mountain lake</a>, and only ventures out on <a href="Weather.html" title="Weather">rainy</a> <a href="Spring.html" title="Spring">spring</a> days to nibble at the frog's eggs. Only the most skilled fisherman can hope to catch this one.
</p><p>Train at <a href="Fishing.html" title="Fishing">fishing</a> and be persistent, and eventually you will catch these elusive fish. Make sure to respect the water and don't remove too many fish from the ecosystem.

<td id="Goblins">Goblins
<p>by M. Jasper
</p>
</td>
<td>The species commonly known as "Goblin" seems to have originated in the forests of the far northeast, beyond the Bluemire Hills. Characterized by their green skin, bright red eyes, and foul smell, initial encounters with Goblins can be frightening for unexperienced travellers.
<p>Despite their unsettling appearance, Goblins possess an intellectual and emotional capacity akin to humans, and have no trouble learning our customs and languages. The goblins I've met have been rather friendly and amiable, once I've shown that I mean no harm. Unfortunately, centuries of distrust and ill-treatment from humans has led many Goblins to pursue careers in the employment of witches, warlocks, necromancers, and other unsavory types.
</p><p>A traditional Goblin diet consists of grub meat, typically from the large and juicy grub varieties native to the Goblin home-forest. On special occasions, Goblins will indulge in an item called '<a href="Void_Mayonnaise.html" title="Void Mayonnaise">void mayonnaise</a>'... considered perhaps the finest delicacy in all Goblin cuisine.
