<dl><dd><ul><li><i>In connection with a sale or other transfer of our business</i>: In the event all or some of our assets are sold, assigned, or transferred to or acquired by another company due to a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, financing, bankruptcy, or otherwise, your Personal Data may be among the transferred assets.</li></ul></dd></dl>

</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<tbody><tr>
<td style="padding: 12px;">We may disclose your Personal Data to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Data for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Data confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. These service providers and contractors include our:

<i><b>7. How is my Personal Data protected?</b></i>
</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<tbody><tr>
<td style="padding: 12px;"><u>Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies</u>
<p>We protect your Personal Data through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li><i>Limited retention</i>: We retain each category of Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Data was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Data collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Use if your profile has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we process the Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Data if we stop operating our Game or the feature through which the Personal Data was acquired.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li><i>Purpose limitation</i>: We will use your Personal Data only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li><i>Security measures</i>: We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Data processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. For example, we use a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted. Such information is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and that are required to keep the information confidential, subject to any additional requirements imposed by our contract with them and applicable law. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Data. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p><u>Your Practices and Activities</u>
</p><p>Your practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Data. You should take certain steps to help protect your Personal Data, such as being mindful of what you share publicly on the Services, including the below.
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Do not use your real name when selecting a username.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Do not post your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else in public-facing areas of the Services.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>Please remember that we have no control over what other users do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding other users.

</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li><i>Right to Know and Access</i>: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Data. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you the following, to the extent retained by us:
<ul><li>the categories of Personal Data we collected about you;</li>

Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers and contractors to delete) your Personal Data from our records, unless an exception under applicable law applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers or contractors to:
<ul><li>complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Data, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, provide the Services that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>

<li>enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with user expectations based on your relationship with us and compatible with the context in which you provided the Personal Data; or</li>
<li>comply with a legal obligation.</li></ul></li></ul></dd></dl>

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Data. The verifiable consumer request must:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative; and</li>
<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Data relates to you. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
</p><p><u>Response Timing and Format</u>
</p><p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response to that profile. If you do not have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
</p><p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request, unless you request a longer period of time for Personal Data we collected about you after January 1, 2022. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
</p><p>To appeal a decision regarding your verifiable consumer request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
</p><p>For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable, easy-to-understand, and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
</p><p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
