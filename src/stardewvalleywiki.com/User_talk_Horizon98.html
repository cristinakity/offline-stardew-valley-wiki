<p>I'm sorry to say this, but you aren't listening to my comments when I say not to make a particular change.  Repeatedly undoing edits by an Admin is, strictly speaking, a violation of wiki policy.  It also creates a lot more work for me.
</p><p>I understand that you have only the best intentions.  You need to understand that when I say "no" to a change, I've thought about it and made the best and final decision for the wikis, based on information that you may not have.  Please consider this a formal request to stop undoing Admin edits and changing templates without discussion, or after I've specifically instructed you not to. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a>(<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 00:08, 17 May 2021 (UTC)

<p>I created the <a href="User_Horizon98/Crop_Growth_Calendars.html" title="User:Horizon98/Crop Growth Calendars">Module:Crop Growth Calendars</a> and <a href="User_Horizon98/CraftingRecipes.html" title="User:Horizon98/CraftingRecipes">Module:CraftingRecipes</a> to reduce the repeated work which has to be done in the future update. They work well and we can update or translate the data easily. For exaple, I can use about one minute to list one crop's growth calendars with the module, and use several seconds to totally update it with another speed. But I have to use more than half an hour to list one calendar with wikitext. I took about 5 minutes to translate <a href="Template_CraftingRecipes.html" title="Template:CraftingRecipes">Template:CraftingRecipes</a> to another language and you took more than 20 minutes. Even if there are one more craftable objects in the future, the form has to be updated entirely. While using the module, it only takes several minutes to update the data.
</p><p>You said that <i>I've thought about it and made the best and final decision for the wikis, based on information that you may not have.</i>. You could explain the decision instead of saying <i>based on information that I don't have</i>.
</p><p>Apart from this, I created the <a href="Template_CraftingRecipes.html" title="Template:CraftingRecipes">Template:CraftingRecipes</a>. But you reverted my update of the template without practical reason. In other words, did I lose the permission to edit the template that I created?

<p>I have talked on your talk page or other relating pages before editing templates. But you don't provide practical reasons why you refuse to use the module, or just ignored the talks. In some situation, you reverted my edit on other pages without reason.

<p>I don't think what you have done is a good way to solve problems, especially as an admin. The only way to solve problems is communication.

<p>I've asked you not to use your bot account to update thousands of pages with language links, and you've indicated that you intend to do so anyway.
</p><p>My reasons are multiple, and include considerations that I need not go into here, but some of the reasons are:
</p>
<ol><li>Your bot account has made mistakes in the past, and cleanup of such a large number of edits would take an immense amount of time</li>
<li>Not all of the pages are created yet; the links exist on the English wiki solely to facilitate page creation in other languages.</li></ol>
<p>I feel I also need to remind you that when an Administrator makes a decision, you are not free to ignore that decision without consequences.  This is also not wikipedia, and wikipedia rules do not necessarily apply.
</p><p>I want us to work together, but you make it difficult by demanding specific reasons for every decision, and then arguing with each one of them.  This is not acceptable behavior, and cannot continue.
</p><p>I've asked you to concentrate your efforts on translation and updating the Chinese wiki.  If you're not interested in doing so, then I thank you for your past efforts and wish you well.  <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:23, 29 June 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thanks for your reply. You can say these words at the first time when I started a discussion on your talkpage. I asked for the explanation because that I don't understand when there is an easier and quicker way to update pages to reduce everyone's work and you refuse to take them. Here are my replies:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><ol><li>The mistakes were made about 5 months ago, and we have talked about that on the <a href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98#Language_Links" class="extiw" title="zh:User talk:Horizon98">zh:User talk:Horizon98#Language Links</a>. Then I took about 2 hours to fix hu links after the talk. And now I've modified the bot's code, it works well as you can see. There's no mistake in the edits of last few days (more than 100 edits).</li>
<li>If you want to avoid adding none-existent pages, it's ok. The original script removes none-existent pages, I modified the code to reserve these links. Just restore those parts of codes, then none-existent pages' language links on none-English wiki will be gone.</li>
<li>I will only use the bot to update interwiki links that have been updated on the English wiki in the future, and it will not update all pages according to your replies.</li>
<li>Yes, this is not wikipedia. But we can learn useful things which can be adapted to this wiki from wikipedia to improve stardew valley wiki.</li>
<li>It's not a good experience when all of your practical improvements are rejected without reason or just ignored by others, so rejecting the ideas with practical reasons is essential. I think that it's a basic politeness in communication.</li>
<li>I have created and translated 67 new pages on Chinese wiki in tha past 5 days. The nearly red <a href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/Template:Navboxfurniture" class="extiw" title="zh:Template:Navboxfurniture">zh:Template:Navboxfurniture</a> is now almost turned into blue resulting from the contribution of me and <a href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/BolingH" class="extiw" title="zh:BolingH">BolingH</a>.</li>
<li>I want us to work together, too. But the precondition is effective communication.</li></ol></dd></dl>

<td>Hi, ConcernedApe! I'm <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Horizon98">Horizon98</a> (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98">talk page</a>) from Stardew Valley wiki. I have made a lot of contributions to the wiki (more than 1000 contributions on Chinese wiki in the past 8 months). I did a lot to translate the wiki and improve the wiki.
<p>But there some contradictions between me and the admin Margotbean. There are many contradictions, including module/template/common pages/wiki policy, etc. I tried to communicate with him, while he repeatly refused to talk. You can see the process on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Horizon98.html">my English talk page</a>. I never did things that harm the wiki, and I don't think that I have violated <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Help_Editing.html">the wiki policy</a>.
</p><p>Today, I reverted his revision which reverted my edits because that the previous translation was correct, which was just in another order different from English wiki and it's easier to be read. But after <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98#Clint.27s_Schedule">the talk about translating Clint's schedule to Chinese</a>, he banned me and my bot account for this thing. While my bot account has nothing to do with this thing and I don't violate the policy.
</p><p>There's no other active admin on the wiki (I have left messages on other admin's talkpage and sent email to another admin about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Prod.html">other things</a> that irrelevant to this thing). So I have no way but to send emails to you for help.
</p><p>Margotbean is a really good editor, but he isn't a qualified admin in my opinion.  You can visit <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Desert_Trader_on_main_page">his talkpage</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Stardew_Valley_Wiki_Admin_noticeboard.html#Term_inconsistency.2C_common_sense_redirects.2C_style_guide">the Admin noticeboard</a>, there are some other topics relating to improve the wiki that he didn't reply and refuse to take them. So I want to accuse Margotbean of abusing his rights to ban me for improper reason and refusing to reply talks relating to improve the wiki.
</p><p>I have send messages to your twitter, but I'm afraid that my messages would be sunk in your twitter. Please forgive me for bothering you again :(
</p><p>Best regards, Horizon98.

<td>Hello Horizon98:
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of ConcernedApe, in response to your email about Margotbean. I am somewhat aware of the situation already, but I have mostly heard Margotbean's side of the story. I would be curious to hear yours, so that I can try and take appropriate action. 
</p><p>To give you some context, I rely on Margotbean to act as admin to the wiki and do their best to monitor what goes on &amp; keep me informed. I know that maintaining such a wiki is difficult, because it requires lots of attention and interacts with many different people. I also know that you have made lots of contributions to the wiki and for that we are grateful.
</p><p>One of the complaints I heard about your process, is that the bot has caused some frustrating issues which require reverts or fixing. Can you tell me your thoughts on this? How often the bot is used, and what kind of issues it may have created in the past?
</p><p>The more information I have, the better I can respond to this issue and hopefully we can find a way to improve things. Thank you!

<td>Hi, Cole. Really thanks for your reply and Eric's help!
<p>The bot using <a class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot">pywikibot</a> was created in January to update redirect links relating to translation changes on the Chinese wiki in the beginning (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Special:%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E8%B4%A1%E7%8C%AE/Horizon_Bot&amp;dir=prev&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Horizon+Bot">its oldest contributions</a>), similar to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Special_ReplaceText.html">ReplaceText page</a> which I can't use. Then I found a script called <a class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/interwiki.py">interwiki.py</a> to update interwiki links because that most pages' interwiki links on zh wiki needed to be updated.
</p><p>The script did work. But there's a small problem about Hungarian link's order. The Hungarian ("hu") link was moved to the place between "fr" and "it" link which is in alphabetical order instead of the previous place between "ko" and "pt" because of the pywikibot framework code, which influenced about 350 pages on zh wiki. I realized the problem when I was operating the bot, but I thought it was a small problem and it didn't matter, and honestly I didn't know what caused the problem at that time. Then Margotbean talked on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98#Language_Links">my talkpage#Language Links</a>. He also said that's a small problem. Then I made an apology and used the script <a class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot/replace.py">replace.py</a> to fixed that in 2 hours.
</p><p>Several days after this work, I used the bot to update all items' gifting on zh wiki (mainly update Leo's preferences). It worked well and all pages were updated correctly.
</p><p>Since my bot didn't belong to the  bots group, its edit history occupied nearly the whole "recent changes" page. So I asked the previous server admin Katzeus to add my bot to the bot group on zh wiki: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/User_talk:Katzeus#About_moving_my_bot_account_to_Bot_Group">User talk:Katzeus#About moving my bot account to Bot Group</a>. He accepted the application.
</p><p>After that, I didn't use the bot frequently. It's only used to update redirect links or replace text relating to translation changes sometimes which avoid repeating work.
</p><p>On June 27, I tried to modify the script interwiki.py and the framework's code to fix the problem that I mentioned before. I did several test on the page <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=%E9%9D%92%E8%B1%86&amp;action=history">青豆</a>. And the fix works, everything works well. Since I found that there are many items' Chinese translations changed in 1.4 or 1.5 in my work, I used the bot to update these pages' language links on other languages wikis. For example: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://de.stardewvalleywiki.com/Spezial:Beiträge/Horizon_Bot">de</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://es.stardewvalleywiki.com/Especial:Contribuciones/Horizon_Bot">es</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://fr.stardewvalleywiki.com/Spécial:Contributions/Horizon_Bot">fr</a>. It works very well, so <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Using_bot_to_update_interwiki_links">I asked Margotbean</a> that could I update all pages's interwiki links on all wikis. But he said no without giving any reason even I asked him again. Then I told him I'll update all pages next day since he didn't give any reason. After that, another contradiction began. He threatened me to ban my account. He also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Horizon98.html#Language_Links">left messages on my talkpage</a> which tried to explain and prevent me from doing this thing. But in my opinon, these reasons are not forceful and I refuted these reasons. However, I also said that I would only use the bot to update interwiki links that have been updated on the English wiki in the future.
</p><p>This should be the whole process about my bot account. Thanks for your patience to read here. In my opinion, the only issue that my bot did was about hu link's order which is not a big problem and fixed by the bot itself quickly.
</p><p>As the email said that I sent before, there are many contradictions between Margotbean and me. Mostly of them have records on his talkpage and mine (both on en and zh wiki).
</p><p>After the ban, I left <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Using_bot_to_update_interwiki_links">a short message</a> on his english talkpage about this. There's another experienced editor <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_Dubesor.html">Dubesor</a> expressed his opinion about Margotbean. You can also read about it.
</p><p>Honestly, Margotbean is a really good and experienced editor on SDV wiki and he should did the most edits on SDV wiki. It's a hard work to maintain the wiki for several years. I also expressed my admiration to him more than once in the talk between him and me. However, he refuses to cooperate with others and tends to do everything by himself which is impossible sometimes. It looks that there isn't a second person can take SDV's admin at present, but I hope that he can learn how to be a better admin.
</p><p>At last, there's one more thing I want to ask your help. It's about Chinese wiki's SEO problem. I have talked about that on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Stardew_Valley_Wiki_Admin_noticeboard.html#Wiki.27s_name_in_other_languages_.28About_SEO.29">Admin noticeboard</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Prod.html">Prod's talkpage</a>, but there's no further reply since now. After the changes of the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Template:InfoboxSEO&amp;action=history">template infoboxSEO</a> on zh wiki, there are now <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://www.baidu.com/s?ie=utf-8&amp;wd=site%3Azh.stardewvalleywiki.com">nearly 10,000 results</a> instead of 0 from zh wiki on the most popular search engine Baidu in China. But the weight is low, so the wiki's result doesn't appear in the first few pages. Therefore, could you consider changing the whole sitename of zh wiki to Chinese? Other languages' wiki might have similar problem. There are also many other constructive suggestions about wiki's settings on the Admin noticeboard, too.
</p><p>Thanks for your reply again! My English is not very well, so there might be some grammer or typo problems. I'm sorry for this.

<td>Hello! Sorry to leave you waiting, I have been investigating and also chatting with Margotbean about things.
<p>I'm going to post a reply to some of the folks who have been commenting on Margotbean's talk page, regarding concerns of abuse. The post will likely be similar to what I'll share here with you. Essentially I want to make it clear that everyone involved in maintaining the wiki, the forums, etc. all want to encourage communication and goodwill. We want the things that are related to Stardew Valley to uphold its core values: inclusion and harmony. The challenge is, we're an extremely small team and the amount of people who make up the community is very large. In Margotbean's case, they are trying to do a lot and they are only one person with limited time and energy. Oftentimes that means they are doing their best but can easily be overwhelmed. Because of this their communications can seem brief and perhaps sound harsh. But I also know that Margotbean has a passion for the wiki, and also recognizes you as a major contributor. They appreciate the work you've done, but they struggle with the disagreements. At least in the immediate future, these guidelines should help:
</p><p>1) Please do not edit templates without approval.
</p><p>2) Admin will do their best to respond to questions, but please keep in mind their time is limited.
</p><p>3) Please do not mark pages being edited with a "do not edit" template. Just simply make the edits.
</p><p>4) Wikipedia rules and norms may not apply to the SDV wiki. The best way to learn the process here is through observation and discussion.
</p><p>I don't want to exclude you (or anyone) from making contributions, but I do want to ask a favor of you: if you can try to meet in the middle with Margotbean, or try to respect that their requests may have reasons that you don't agree with, then I will ask that they lift your ban now. I depend on Margotbean as admin because I cannot be as active in the wiki as I'd like to be. If you can try to support their decisions I would be grateful. If you do have a problem where you feel very strongly about something and cannot resolve it with Margotbean, you can email me directly for my opinion and I'll see what I think.
</p><p>Let me know if you feel this sounds reasonable and we'll go from there. Thank you!
</p><p>- Cole

<td>Hi, Cole! Thanks for your investigation and reply.
<p>I have some suggestions about the guidelines. Margotbean said similar words like these guidelines in the talks before, so I guess these guidelines are mainly proposed by him.
</p><p>1) Please do not edit templates without approval.
</p><p>2) Admin will do their best to respond to questions, but please keep in mind their time is limited.
</p><p>I agree with the second guideline. Admin devotes several hours to maintain the wiki every day and there's no rule that they should reply to each talk. But the first guideline is inconsistent with the second one in actual work, at least in my experiences. 
</p><p>I tried to communicate with him before chaging templates at the beginning, but he rejected these changes with some reasons or just no reason which I have replied later. I explained the editing reasons while he didn't give any further reply. Here are 2 examples: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Talk_Crop_Growth_Calendars.html#Using_module_to_replace_this_page">Talk:Crop Growth Calendars#Using module to replace this page</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Apply_for_the_permission_to_edit_module_pages">User talk:Margotbean#Apply for the permission to edit module pages</a>. If the admin can't give proper reason to refuse these edits, it's better not to add this point into the rules.
</p><p>Apart from this, not all templates were created by admins. They can't be familiar with each template's code and handle those templates. There many templates which use complex logic or codes. And I think that the template's creater should have the permission to edit these templates. For example, I created <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Template_CraftingRecipes.html">Template:CraftingRecipes</a> on the Chinese wiki first. It's not a complex template, but it took me hours to measure the px size with Photoshop. A few days later, I translated the template to the English wiki. It works well until Margotbean changed site's styling which broke the template: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Template_talk_CraftingRecipes.html#Broken%20Template">Template talk:CraftingRecipes#Broken Template</a>. (I don't mean to blame him for breaking the tempalte.) Then I fixed the template temporarily: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mediawiki/indexcddf.html?title=Template:CraftingRecipes/styles.css&amp;oldid=120605">Template:CraftingRecipes/styles.css</a>. And I re-writed the template later, when I asked for the permission to update the template and I said that I can help with updating other languages wikis template, he just ignored the talk which he has patroled. After I asking for it again, he just replied that "Thanks, I've got it covered". I think it's truly unacceptable. There's a simple question, which template that you think better? <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_Horizon98/Sandbox/CraftingRecipes.html">User:Horizon98/Sandbox/CraftingRecipes</a> VS <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Template_CraftingRecipes.html">Template:CraftingRecipes</a>. (The background images used in my template sandbox were deleted by him.)
</p><p>3) Please do not mark pages being edited with a "do not edit" template. Just simply make the edits.
</p><p>This guideline is about this talk and relating templates: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean#In_use_Template">User talk:Margotbean#In use Template</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Template:Construction&amp;action=history">Template:Construction</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Special:%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97&amp;page=Template:%E6%AD%A3%E5%9C%A8%E7%BC%96%E8%BE%91">Template:正在编辑</a>(Means "In use"). I edited or created these templates to avoid edit conflicts which I had come across before. After I adding many contents and press "saving" or "preview" button, nothing changed and my edits are lost. Then I found the reason that someone did small edit and saved the page when I edited same page. Then I lose the content as well as several hours work. I changed the template just to avoid this situation. I also said in the template that "If the page isn't updated for long term, please help remove this template." and let others specified the expected time when using the template in the template doc. I think this template is useful and another editor also think that the template is useful: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98#.E6.AD.A3.E5.9C.A8.E6.96.BD.E5.B7.A5">User talk:Horizon98#正在施工</a>(means "under construction").
</p><p>Thus, I think It's reasonable to warn other editors of this situation. And it just a-few-hours or a-few-days notice, not a lont-term notice.
</p><p>4) Wikipedia rules and norms may not apply to the SDV wiki. The best way to learn the process here is through observation and discussion.
</p><p>I agree with this point. But we can learn something useful from wikipedia. And as you said, the best way to learn the process here is through observation and discussion. I have also referring to this many times during the talks between Margotbean and me. Although I agree with the second guideline, but when the admin can and have the ability reply to the questions, it's better to reply the doubts instead of ignoring them or just replying with short and meaningless words, and then marking the page patrolled.
</p><p>Thanks for reading here! But there's one thing that I can't understand. You said that you thought the bot is not an issue anymore. I don't understand what you means... Would you like to explain it more detailedly? 
</p><p>Besides, there are some other editors (both new editors and experienced editors) have replied on the Margotbean's talkpage under this topic which you have read. But there's none of them in the same line with the admin. I think that it has meant something and it must have a reason.
</p><p>At last, I want to copy these emails and communication process to that talkpage transparently. So I want to know your opinion and ask for your permission to open these emails.
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and hard work again!
</p><p>Best regards.

<td>Hey there!
<p>First of all, I appreciate how polite and thoughtful your messages and posts have been.This goes a long way with me. So thank you! With regards to getting approval for template changes, I hear what you're saying and it makes sense. I just want to put a limit on this process a little bit, to make sure it is manageable. Here's the process I propose:
</p><p>1) If you want to change a template, you explain the change and ask Margotbean about it (I will encourage Margotbean to be as responsive as possible to these requests so you're not kept waiting).
</p><p>2) Margotbean will then either say "Go ahead!" or "Here's the reason why I don't want this changed."
</p><p>3) If you wish to contest the reason, you can do so.
</p><p>4) Margotbean will then respond either accepting your reasons and say "Go ahead!" or "No, this proposal is denied." And at that point, the conversation needs to respectfully end.
</p><p>Regarding the issue of: "Please do not mark pages being edited with a "do not edit" template. Just simply make the edits." You were saying that you do this to avoid losing lots of work. But what is being communicated to me, is that this is not an issue for the SDV wiki. There are edit conflict warnings, and not enough editors for this to be a major issue. The problem with doing this is that marking a page as 'Being worked on, do not edit' discourages others from working on pages unnecessarily.
</p><p>Regarding the bot, I was under the impression it was causing trouble / breaking things, and therefore part of the ban. But I was wrong, the bot is not causing trouble.
</p><p>I have been following the thread on Margotbean's talk page. I know other people are frustrated as well. I would like to try and address problems in smaller chunks, and I encourage those folks to reach out to me if they can - with concrete problems so that we can find concrete solutions. Overall it sounds like people would like more explanation for why certain decisions are made. I have encouraged Margotbean to do so. You can share these emails on your Talk Page if you like, though they are more about communicating with you about your specific issues rather than larger site-wide policy.
</p><p>Thanks again for all your contributions to the wiki!
</p><p>- Cole

<td>Hello, Cole!
<p>Thanks to you for proposing the process of changing templates. It seems to be reasonable and effective. And I just tested on the wiki, it looks like the problem about edit conflict doesn't exist now which I came across before the wiki transfer. At present, there's no problem about the guidelines as far as I'm concerned. 
</p><p>Therefore, we can come back to the topic about the ban itself. I want to know why have I and my bot account  been banned because of violation of the wiki policy. Before the ban, I replied to the talk about <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98#Clint.27s_Schedule">Clint's Schedule</a> and then reverted the English schedule to the correct and better organized Chinese schedule. Also, I used my bot to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewvalleywiki.com/Special:用户贡献/Horizon_Bot">correct the wrong machine translation title</a>. In my opinion, what I did doesn't harm the wiki. Instead, it helps improve the wiki and I tried to communicate with politeness. So, I want to know the exact policy that I violated and my bot violated. Or was the ban unjustified? 
</p><p>Besides, I want to know whether Margotbean abused his rights or not. Apart from this issue, the treat to ban my account in the talk: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Using_bot_to_update_interwiki_links">Using bot to update interwiki links</a> is another issue where he may abuse the right. I agree with <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mediawiki/indexd9c6.html?title=User_talk:Margotbean&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=124778">User6789's opinion</a> on this thing: "Bots are allowed on most wikis for a reason (you have no policy stating people can't, and anyone can edit via the MW API without you ever realizing they're using a bot, as long as it is well throttled). The ability to disable the edit API no longer exists in MW."
</p><p>I know the above two questions may be difficult to answer, but we need a fair judgement and result. 
</p><p>Regarding to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Template_CraftingRecipes.html">template:CraftingRecipes</a>, I'm still insisting on updating the template. The present template is unclear in mobile view. While the template generated by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_Horizon98/CraftingRecipes.html">module in my sandbox</a> is clearer and more Intuitive. Furthermore, if there are only one more crafting item in the future, although I don't know whether the game had 1.6 or not, the present template has to be rewrited totally. So for the improvement of the wiki, I want to know your opinion about this template.
</p><p>In addition to the above, there are some constructive suggestions proposed by experienced editors which are worth took into consideration by admins (especially server admin) on the wiki. Here's the list that I collected:
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_talk_Margotbean.html#Desert_Trader_on_main_page">Desert Trader on main page</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="User_Zendowolf/Sandbox/MainMenu.html">User:Zendowolf/Sandbox/MainMenu</a>

</p><p><br>
I think the short answer is that you are free to make changes and propose changes, but if an Admin asks you not to do something, their ask should be respected. In this case I saw the message that warned if you proceeded, you'd receive a ban. In the future I am going to ask that a ban warning be accompanied with more of an explanation as to why the proposed change or action is not wanted. But ultimately I think that an Admins judgement is required in these situations.
</p><p><br>
<i>Besides, I want to know whether Margotbean abused his rights or not. Apart from this issue, the treat to ban my account in the talk: Using bot to update interwiki links is another issue where he may abuse the right.

</p><p><br>
The issue is not that a bot was used, it was more that Margotbean asked you not to proceed, saying "I do not think that is a good idea at this time, but I appreciate your interest." There can be lots of reasons this is the case. 
</p><p><br>

</p><p><br>
Please use the process we outlined in the previous email to carry out this change in communication with Margotbean. I think it's just a good safety check before making a major change.
</p><p><br>
<i>In addition to the above, there are some constructive suggestions proposed by experienced editors which are worth took into consideration by admins (especially server admin) on the wiki. Here's the list that I collected:</i>

</p><p><i>Term inconsistency, common sense redirects, style guide</i>
</p><p><i>Css on login page via config setting</i>
</p><p><br>
Thanks for these, I will take a look as soon as I can and see what we can take from these suggestions.
</p><p>I am going to ask that Margotbean lift the ban and so we can try out some of the methods we discussed. Appreciate your patience and willingness to communicate with me.

<p>Hello again, Horizon98! I was thinking: I am trying to find ways to be more productive for the wiki, and during my last project, <b>Coat of many colors</b>, I found your bot to be <b>VERY</b> useful. And if I am going to be doing more of those sorta projects, I do not want to need to harass you every time I start a project to ask you to use your bot.
