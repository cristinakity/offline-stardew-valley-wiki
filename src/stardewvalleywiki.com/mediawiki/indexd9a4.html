==Silver Quality Crab Pot Items==
Tried to turn this

"Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0"

Into this:

"Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0,1" to add only silver quality items for crab pot items since there are silver quality crab pot items for 1.6, but it just makes the row blank in preview. Can I get the proper way to do it please? --[[User:Rayram|Rayram]] ([[User talk:Rayram|talk]]) 08:20, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

==Gold star crafted edibles==
The table lists a gold star Oil of Garlic and Life Elixer as being a possible Cooked category items, with a value of 6, but Qi Seasoning doesn't activate when creating Oil of Garlic or Life Elixer through the crafting menu (they're not cooking menu items). Is this a mistake to leave the 6s in there or am I missing something? [[User:Electron.rotoscope|Electron.rotoscope]] ([[User talk:Electron.rotoscope|talk]]) 00:30, 2 March 2021 (UTC)
:Seems like a mistake to me, that ought to be removed from the page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:32, 2 March 2021 (UTC)

==Perferkt Score==
Should a picture showing a display with 125 points achieved added to the page? If yes, next to the screen with 124 points or better in a Gallery section? I currently have a screenshot, [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 20:08, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
:I think it's pretty clear from the text that the only change is to swap out iridium Fiddlehead Fern for an iridium vegetable that gives 8 points, which are listed in the sortable table. So, I don't think an image is necessary.  I also don't want to have to try to fit it in the available space in 12 languages. ;)  Thanks, though!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:12, 11 April 2021 (UTC)

==Special Prices==
I recently had a fair display with a Spring Onion and a Salmonberry in it. The score I got leads me to believe that [[Bear's Knowledge]] and [[Spring Onion Mastery]] both contribute to the score in a fair display. I'm not sure how to add that to the page. There could be a note, next to the note saying professions ''don't'' affect the score, but should there also be additional entries with the enhanced prices and scores for those items? [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 22:59, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
:I don't see where it says profession bonuses don't affect sell price, I see where it says they do affect sell price, but are not included on the page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:03, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
::Are you talking about this sentence?: "Note: Profession bonuses (which affect in-game sell prices) are not included in the calculations on this page." If so, that sentence should be clarified. Since the calculations on this page are calculating your score, I always took it to mean that they were not included in your score. Something like, "Note: Profession bonuses are not included on this page, but they do affect your score." Or rather, "Note: Profession bonuses, Bear's Knowledge, and Spring Onion Mastery are not included on this page, but they do affect your score." [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 23:20, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
:::Yes, that's the sentence I was referring to, and I agree, it could be made more clear. 👍 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:22, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

== Spinning Wheel bets ==

On the page, it's written that according to the Kelly criteria, you should bet 50% of you money...
But If you compute it, it's 0.75 - (0.25 / 2) = 62.5%, which is more than just half--[[User:Ishigh|Ishigh]] ([[User talk:Ishigh|talk]]) 11:44, 20 July 2021 (UTC)
:It's not my area of expertise, but it appears the calculation was "simplified for the case of doubling a bet."  &lt;samp>(2 * Probability of Winning) - 1&lt;/samp> comes out to 50%. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:24, 20 July 2021 (UTC)

== Lost and Found Box ==

Would it be feasible to put a 1.5 spoiler where there are mentions of 1.5 things? Lost and Found was added in 1.5 and I play on mobile. I just wanna help someone else not make my mistake of having a false sense of security. RIP to my second Prismatic Shard. [[User:TexWashington|TexWashington]] ([[User talk:TexWashington|talk]]) 06:56, 1 December 2021 (UTC)
:I'm really sorry that happened to you! I've added another spoiler box to the section regarding the lost and found box. I don't think anyone expected the mobile v1.5 update to take a whole year, but here we are. Future advice: read the history sections of relevant pages to avoid another catastrophic loss! Again, so sorry that happened! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:15, 1 December 2021 (UTC)

== Energy bar particles from a Stardrop ==

Before the 1.4 update, I saw some people on YouTube that have gotten the Stardrop at the Fair, and still seeing the particles where the Energy bar would be. When I first saw this, I was going to say: "THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP." [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 7:25, 19 July 2022 (UTC)

== Clicking on the cliff above [[Harvey's Clinic]] at the Stardew Valley Fair ==

Since of lads are used to the Strength Game to where you can obtain Star Tokens at the Fair, Apparently if we go above [[Harvey's Clinic]] and click on the cliff while we're facing east towards [[Pierre's General Store]], it gives out the message "Please stand at the red arrow." as if we're gonna play the Strength Game. This has to be a bug because the wiki doesn't have this bug in the Bugs section of the Fair page. We should get lads over to check this out... [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:40, 22 May 2023 (UTC)
:This bug was fixed in v1.5. Please read the "History" section of the page. If your game is malfunctioning, please file a bug report on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/ official forums]. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:48, 22 May 2023 (UTC)

== Compress redundant Artisan Goods entries ==

Instead of listing each Wine, Juice, Jelly, Pickle, and Aged Roe type individually, I think they should be compressed so that all Wine variants that have the same value for each quality all share a single line. - [[User:Starfarmer|Starfarmer]] ([[User talk:Starfarmer|talk]]) 17:06, 25 September 2023 (UTC)

:Absolutely agree. It's really hard to read right now even without newer additions like dried fruit or smoked fish. --[[User:Optimatum|Optimatum]] ([[User talk:Optimatum|talk]]) 16:20, 7 May 2024 (UTC)

==Alternative Stategy==

The page says '''always''' bet half your start tokens on green. I tried this twice on the same day, and both times went from over 1,000 stars to less than 100. I think it would be worthwhile for the page to mention another strategy that I have seen explained in other places online: First, bet 160 on green. If you win repeat. If you lose, double it: bet 320 on green. Usually, you'll win. In the rare case when you lose that, double it again: bet 640 on green. Any time you win, bet 160 on green again. Maybe my fair was on an unlucky day or something, but I found that effective on the same day that always betting half was not.  [[User:DemonOfSarila|DemonOfSarila]] ([[User talk:DemonOfSarila|talk]]) 20:13, 14 October 2023 (UTC)
:In any single case, RNG might not be in your favor, but overall, the Kelly criterion will work. If you had kept at it, your 100g would have gone up. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:02, 14 October 2023 (UTC)

== Spinner Odds Calculations ==

Given the lack of source for the "3x as Likely" claim given in the description, I decided to crunch the numbers myself for the various starting velocities. 7/30 possible starting velocities result in Orange, with the remaining being Green. This is verifiable by code analysis.
:I'm deleting the image, a link to a google spreadsheet would be better so people can see the underlying formulas. But, if the calculations are verifiable by code reference, then the image isn't needed. Please remember to sign your posts with 4 tildes! Thanks! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:41, 16 April 2024 (UTC)
::Hi! I've attempted to replicate this, but found 8 of the initial conditions resulting in Orange. I've put a table of my results on [[User:Wikonimo#Wheel Spin Outcomes|my user page]], and would appreciate if you could compare them with your results to see where one of us has gone wrong. [[User:Wikonimo|Wikonimo]] ([[User talk:Wikonimo|talk]]) 21:04, 17 May 2024 (UTC)

== Gus cooking Survival Burgers in the East? ==

On my current playthrough I've just reached the Year 2 fair, and I noticed that Gus had the grills setup in the east rather than the north as usual (and as in year 1). Unfortunately I didn't really think much of it until I had already left the fair and ended the day, so I don't have a screenshot or know what (if anything) was in the north. Has anyone else noticed this? [[User:GTink911|GTink911]] ([[User talk:GTink911|talk]]) 15:39, 22 April 2024 (UTC)

I think most festivals now have a unique layout on every other year. [[User:Bredzisz|Bredzisz]] ([[User talk:Bredzisz|talk]]) 15:56, 22 April 2024 (UTC)

== Grange Display info for 1.6 ==

The list of grange display items needs to be updated for items added in 1.6. I was wondering about Mystic Syrup in particular: I assume it counts as a forage item like the other tree saps, but how does it score compared to quality items in that category? --[[User:Optimatum|Optimatum]] ([[User talk:Optimatum|talk]]) 16:16, 7 May 2024 (UTC)
