{{Quote|Sam is an outgoing, friendly guy who is brimming with youthful energy. He plays guitar and drums, and wants to start a band with Sebastian as soon as he has enough songs together. However, he does have a habit of starting ambitious projects and not finishing them. Sam is a little stressed about the impending return of his father, who has been away for years due to his line of work.|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Sam''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in [[Pelican Town]]. He's one of the twelve characters available to [[marriage|marry]]. He lives in the southern part of town, just north of the river at [[1 Willow Lane]].

Sam is an outgoing and energetic young man with a passion for music. He works part-time at [[JojaMart]]. In his free time, he plays guitar. Despite his description in Dev Update 12, he does not actually ever play drums. He also skateboards and can be found playing videogames.

==Schedule==
Sam can often be found practicing his guitar in [[1 Willow Lane|his bedroom]] sometimes with [[Sebastian]] playing an electric piano. He's also frequently seen outside of his house playing a handheld video game, or attempting skateboard tricks. On weekends he can be found playing pool at [[the Stardrop Saloon]].

He works part-time on Monday and Wednesday at [[JojaMart]] (if it is in business), or at the [[Museum]] in the [[Artifacts]] and [[Minerals]] display (if the [[Community Center]] has been restored). He frequents the Stardrop Saloon during [[spring]], goes to [[the Beach]] during [[summer]], and visits [[Cindersap Forest|the woods]] west of town in the [[fall]].

When it's raining he'll often stay home all day, or visit [[the Stardrop Saloon]] for a few hours.

On the 11th of Fall, he has an appointment at the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]].

His schedule can deviate if there are specific conditions like season, weather or certain days of the week.

After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Sam may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Sam will immediately go home to bed. Sam never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or his checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Below are his schedule deviations prioritized highest to lowest (for example when it rains that schedule will override all others below it)

==Relationships==
Sam lives with his mother [[Jodi]] and younger brother [[Vincent]]. His mother spoils both of them, and claims that neither have ever had to do any chores. He is close to Vincent, and feels responsible for him during his dad's absence. In Spring, Year 2, Sam's father [[Kent]] returns and resides in the house with the rest of the family. After marriage, Sam will visit his family regularly to check up on them.  

[[Sebastian]] and [[Abigail]] are his bandmates and closest friends, and they often spend time together. When they are hanging out at [[The Stardrop Saloon]], Sebastian is always seen beating Sam at pool, while Abigail watches from the couch. He is also friends with [[Penny]], and will dance with her at the [[Flower Dance]] if neither of them is dancing with the player.

 |hearts  = 2
 |trigger = Enter Sam's house when he's there.

* {{choice|"Cheerful pop music."|0}}
* {{choice|"Experimental noise rock."|0}}
* {{choice|"Hi-Energy dance music."|0}}
* {{choice|"Honky-tonky country music."|0}}

No matter which style you pick, Sam says that's the style he's been thinking about for the band. He asks Sebastian if he's on board too. Sebastian agrees and Sam thanks you.

Note that if you skip this cutscene, Sam's 8-heart cutscene will not have any music playing.
}}

===Three Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 3
 |trigger = In any season except winter, enter the beach on a sunny day between 7am and 3pm. This event only happens in Year 1.
 |details = Sam is watching his brother [[Vincent]] play in the sand. Sam says his dad used to take them to the beach on sunny days. Vincent asks if their father will come home. Sam says "Of course". Vincent mentions overhearing people talk about mass military casualties. Sam tells him not to believe them, and Vincent returns to playing. Sam feels bad for getting his brother's hopes up and asks for your opinion.

* {{choice|"It's best to be honest with kids."|0}} Sam questions your thoughts, but then agrees that kids have to learn about the world one way or another.
* {{choice|"You did the right thing. Kids should have hope."|0}} Sam agrees and says kids should hang on to their childhood as long as they can.

Sam tells you the band's coming together, and Sebastian really wanted Abigail to be the drummer.
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 4
 |trigger = Enter Sam's house when he's there.
 |details = Sam is in the kitchen. He says hello. As he's getting you a snack, he drops an egg on the kitchen floor. His mom hears the commotion, walks into the kitchen, and becomes upset about the mess. Sam asks you to tell her what happened.

* {{choice|"Sam dropped the snack as he was handing it to me."|-10}}
* {{choice|"Sam handed me the snack and then I dropped it."|50}} Sam agrees with you.
* {{choice|"Sam dropped it on purpose. He thought it would be funny."|-50}}

Jodi thanks you for being honest, and Sam insists he'll clean up the mess. 

Talking to Sam after this event causes him to say "Sorry about what happened earlier."
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = On any day when it's not raining, enter the town between noon and 4pm.
 |details = Sam is skateboarding and grinding on Emily and Haley's flower box. Lewis catches him and scolds him for it. Lewis asks for your opinion.

* {{choice|"You're right, sir. Sam should respect private property."|0}} Sam is unhappy, but obliges and says he'll just not skateboard ever again.
* {{choice|"Don't blame Sam. There's nowhere else to ride!"|0}} Sam seems happy and agrees. Mayor Lewis becomes frustrated and states that he thought you were more mature than that but afterwards apologizes to Sam and asks him to be more careful in the future.
* {{choice|"I'm staying out of this."|0}} Mayor Lewis says he doesn't want to see Sam doing it again, Sam agrees and the Mayor leaves. Then Sam turns to you and, with a smile, asks if you saw his rad trick.
}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = Sam shows up at your doorstep between 6am and 8am. Only triggers if you've seen his two-heart event.
 |details = Sam invites you to see his band play in [[Setting#Zuzu City|Zuzu City]] and asks to meet at the [[Bus Stop|bus stop]] at 4pm. Enter the bus stop map between 4pm and 7pm to meet Sam and the others, and watch them play. He thanks you for inspiring his band with the type of music they should play. This heart event does not require the bus to be repaired.

Note that if you have skipped Sam's 2-heart cutscene, no music will play during this heart event.

Additionally, no time will have passed during the heart scene (unlike festivals, which always end the day), so if the bus stop map is entered at 4pm, you will return at 4pm as well.

[[File:Sam's gig.gif]]
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = After receiving a letter from Sam, enter the town on a sunny day between 8pm and midnight.
 |details = You meet Sam outside his house. He says it's cold outside and sneaks you into his room to talk privately. As he admits he's falling for you, his mom knocks on the door. He has you hide in the bed. His mom comes in and asks why he's sweating and red in the face, and Sam says he's just been doing push ups. She wishes him good night and leaves.

You are presented with the option to:
* {{choice|''Get out of the bed.''|0}} (If you take this option, the game presents the following 2 more choices)
** {{choice|''Move Closer.''|0}} You return Sam's affections, and the two of you share a kiss.

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Sam will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a half-pipe behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to practice his skateboarding tricks.

On rainy days, Sam may offer you a gift that he found "rolling around in the back of a drawer":  [[Cactus Fruit]], [[Coconut]], [[Earth Crystal]], or [[Geode]].  On rainy nights, he may offer you [[Pizza]].  On days when Sam stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you instant [[Pancakes]], explaining that he never learned to cook.

==Trivia==
* Sam is allergic to pollen, which he mentions during the [[Egg Festival]]. He also mentions that his "nose is really happy" during summer due to the typically lower pollen count.
* "Sam" is short for "Samson", which he reveals to the player once they have a good relationship with him. He also states that he doesn't want the player to tell anyone.
* On one of Sam's portraits, his undershirt is yellow, but in his sprite, it is red.
