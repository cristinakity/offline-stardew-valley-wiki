[[File:Mail.png|right|100px]]'''Letters''' are messages sent to the player that can be read by interacting with the mailbox that is located on [[The Farm]] and the [[Ginger Island#The Farm|Ginger Island Farm]]. They appear at the start of the day in the player's mailbox on specific days or the day after certain conditions have been met. Letters contain rewards, information about the game's mechanics, hints, reminders and lore. 

Closing a letter with an unclaimed item will automatically attempt to place it into the [[inventory]], provided the player has enough inventory space. Otherwise, a menu will appear, similar to the [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|treasure chest menu]], allowing the player to make room for the item. Dismissing this menu will forfeit the rewarded item.

Most letters received in the mail will be added to the [[Collections|collection tab]]. The tab does not record notices received from passing out at 2am or from low [[health]]. Letters shown do not include any attachments that came with the original letter, such as recipes or gifts.

==Special backgrounds==
Letters received from [[Sandy]], the [[Wizard]], and [[Krobus]] will be written on a unique thematic background:

|&lt;Player>, my love,&lt;br />&lt;br />I've just arrived in Grampleton, to start the tour. I've forgotten how hectic the city is! The streets are packed with people... they either seem in a mad hurry, or lost in a daze, unaware of their surroundings. I miss Pelican Town already!&lt;br />&lt;br />I begin the tour this evening, at a local bookstore. I must admit, I'm becoming a bit nervous at the thought of public speaking... my stomach feels as if it's been twisted into a soft pretzel and doused with spicy cheese dip. Wish me luck!&lt;br />&lt;br />-Love, Elliott&lt;br />&lt;br />P.S. I hope you had a peaceful night, and weren't too scared all alone in that big house!

Still, I sold enough copies of the book to pay for my (bug-infested) hotel room!&lt;br />&lt;br />In a few hours, I leave for Zuzu City. If yesterday's reading was a warm-up, this next one will be a true napalm blast...&lt;br />&lt;br />I miss you very much. Remember to eat well! Oh, and don't forget the leftover crab cakes I put in the fridge...&lt;br />-Love, Elliott

It seems there's a large literary scene here... a few dozen people showed up at my reading!&lt;br />&lt;br />I even signed a couple of autographs... it's strange to be seen as someone important. It's all a matter of framing, a grand illusion... for truly I am no one special. Only your devoted Elliott, as always.&lt;br />&lt;br />Currently I'm alone, in my hotel room, 'ingesting' a Joja Value Meal...&lt;br />&lt;br />Should this be called 'food'?&lt;br />Or 'edible matter'?&lt;br />I needn't long brood&lt;br />It must be the latter&lt;br />&lt;br />I look forward to returning home soon.

|Dear Emily,&lt;br />I know you only think of me as a friend.&lt;br />It's my fault. I'm too shy. I'll never have the courage to tell you the truth.&lt;br />That's why I'm writing this letter to myself that I'll certainly crumple up and toss in the corner.

|{{NPC|Morris}}
|To Mr. Pierre:&lt;br />It pains me to be the bearer of bad news, but I feel obligated to inform you of a recent development most threatening to your livelihood.&lt;br />Joja Co. has decided to expand into Pelican Town.&lt;br />It's too late for protest. Joja Builders have already broken ground for the new JojaMart.&lt;br />&lt;br />This must be devastating news for you. So many years in business...a local standby... and now, obscured by the shadow of a powerful, efficient, economically viable corporation. What a shame!&lt;br />&lt;br />As manager of the new JojaMart, I feel, to some degree, personally responsible for your predicament. As such, I'd like to offer you a position as Assistant Grocer. Wages start at 5g an hour. I look forward to seeing your resume!&lt;br />&lt;br />-Mr. Morris, Manager&lt;br />Pelican Town JojaMart
