==Cost typo==
Are we ''sure'' that Caroline sells a single dandelion for {{Price|410|Egg}}? That seems like a typo. If it is then can we get the correct number there?
[[User:Mellowheart|Mellowheart]] ([[User talk:Mellowheart|talk]]) 23:10, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

:It's definitely a typo. The cost should be 10 but I don't have the game up to verify that.--[[User:Spaceeinstein|Spaceeinstein]] ([[User talk:Spaceeinstein|talk]]) 00:35, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

::I can confirm that it is indeed 10. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 00:38, 23 March 2024 (UTC)

==Page for the egg?==
The Calico Egg itself is an item in the players inventory, should that mean we create a separate page for it? With its description and other properties? [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 14:59, 23 March 2024 (UTC)


==Gold Prices?==

What happened to the egg price tag? Everything is showing as coins now :(

--[[User:Darkstreamfarm|Darkstreamfarm]] ([[User talk:Darkstreamfarm|talk]]) 02:48, 24 March 2024 (UTC)

:Changes to templates need to be discussed first, and then when agreement has been reached, the changes need to be carried out in all 12 languages. The changes to Template:Price weren't discussed, much less agreed upon or carried out in the other languages. Therefore, they have been reverted. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:49, 24 March 2024 (UTC)

::Started the discussion here; [[Template_talk:Price]], everybody feel free to chip in. [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 07:10, 24 March 2024 (UTC)

::: The discussion in price is till ongoing, but I did update the page so it would at least match the latest version in price. If price template is reverted again, we could also think about using &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>[[File:Calico Egg.png|24px|link=]] xyz&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code> for now. --[[User:Maiken|Maiken]] ([[User talk:Maiken|talk]]) 15:10, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

::::I think the template reversion reflects the fact that, since it has wide-spread effects across the Wiki, changes need prior discussion before their implementation. In addition, when the implementation occurs, the changes need to incorporate full language support so they can be seen correctly in every language. It was a procedural objection, and it's clear that several pages at least were adversely affected when procedure was not followed. Let's be clear that a change to the template is definitely allowable, and may be desirable in matters like this, but the time to sort out possible bugs in changes comes *before* the changes are saved to the template itself. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 22:40, 26 March 2024 (UTC)

== Escar-go stats ==

Most of the racers are identical, but Escar-Go is special in 3 locations.
When the racers are initially set up, the default min speed and max speed is 1.5 and 4 respectively; but for Escar-Go, it is 0.5 and 3.5.
For the speed burst (which is applied immediately thereafter and other locations), the default time for a burst is 0.25 to 1; with a chance to double, and then Escar-Go gets that cut by 4.
After the speed burst ends, there is a 0.75 to 1.5 delay for the next burst, with a chance to cut that in half, and for Escar-Go that result is cut by 4.
With the motion, they start off at max speed, and during their speed burst they remain at their max speed.
After the speed burst, they slow down at a rate of 0.5 to go towards their min speed.
My understanding is that due to the boost time and time to next boost both being cut by a factor of 4, their time spent at maximum speed will be equal.
The average time spent at full speed will be 0.78125 or 0.195313 for Escar-Go. The average time spent slowing down will be 0.984375 or 0.246094 for Escar-Go.
However, it looks like the slow down doesn't consider the actual time spent slowing down and instead just updates every time the update function is called.
Is it possible (perhaps due to frame rate) for the normal racers to spend more time slowing down so they go to their min speed, while Escar-Go spends less time slowing down, so Escar-Go on average ends up faster?
And is this frame rate dependent? [[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 22:32, 7 April 2024 (UTC)
:Checking some more, the game usually runs at 60 frames per second, making EscarGo slower, and the slowdown process is basically irrelevant. If it would run at 6-20 frames per second, it would be more luck based. But this is primarily due to the different speeds involved, not the different boost times. [[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 23:16, 9 April 2024 (UTC)

== Food Vendor Stacks ==

So food from the food vendor stacks with normal food and drinks, allowing total boosts like +6 luck (which is great for the casino!) and +3 speed overall [[User:Rangerbookwyrm|Rangerbookwyrm]] ([[User talk:Rangerbookwyrm|talk]]) 07:31, 11 April 2024 (UTC)

== New page for Assassin Bug? ==

Should we make a new page for the Assassin Bug (the one spawned by a Calico Statue effect)? It has its own sprite sheet in the Content\Characters\Monsters folder, and it has different stats than the Armored Bug. I do think they have the exact same drops, though. Any thoughts? [[User:Bluestblur|Bluestblur]] ([[User talk:Bluestblur|talk]]) 00:42, 15 April 2024 (UTC)

== scholar question - steps taken ==

I just got the 'steps taken' question and it said the middle option was incorrect. Does it mean middle as in positioning (which is what I thought it meant) or middle as in value-wise? like one is an incorrect higher number and one is an incorrect lower number? [[User:Rangerbookwyrm|Rangerbookwyrm]] ([[User talk:Rangerbookwyrm|talk]]) 07:09, 28 April 2024 (UTC)
:One is an incorrect higher number and one is an incorrect lower number. I've changed the page to make it more clear. The key is "the order of options is randomized", so the middle value can appear in any of the 3 slots given. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:04, 28 April 2024 (UTC)

== Condition for 100-egg bonus on race win ==

It's not "the first win". I've reloaded and won (on the first day) several times now, with and without sabotage, and gotten 20 eggs every time. There's definitely a bonus in the code (see CollectRacePrizes() in DesertFestival.cs), but I can't figure out what the condition is to get it. Anyone? [[User:Rekiy|Rekiy]] ([[User talk:Rekiy|talk]]) 19:13, 26 May 2024 (UTC)
:Without stepping through the code, the only clue I can find is the string that gets called when the condition is met, from &lt;samp>1_6_Strings.xnb&lt;/samp>: &lt;samp>"Race_Collect_Prize_Special": "Race Announcer: Escar-go... how?? Um...Well, here's your big payout..."&lt;/samp>
:So, the first time Escar-go wins? [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:34, 26 May 2024 (UTC)
::Makes sense, but that result's still crashing. (This has a history. Search for "stardew valley desert festival race crash" on Google.) Presumably Clarineric got it ''some''how.
::Another note btw: I'm not able to get to the desert till Pam gets there at 8:50, even on the first day. (I'd edit the page to say so myself, but I'm new here and don't want to step on any toes. Besides, I'm not sure my own research is proof enough.) [[User:Rekiy|Rekiy]] ([[User talk:Rekiy|talk]]) 00:19, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
:::Could you try winning a bet on Escar-go after already winning a bet on a different contestant that day? [[User:Wikonimo|Wikonimo]] ([[User talk:Wikonimo|talk]]) 01:21, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
::::Bingo! Took a few tries, but can confirm: winning with someone else, then winning with Escar-go lets you collect the 100-egg prize. (It's not a bonus, though - my reward was exactly 100 eggs.) My guess is Escar-go winning is enough, but the game will crash unless you win with someone else first.
::::Another note btw: the chef's food buffs don't last all day. Mine lasted ten hours (from 9 AM to 7 PM). [[User:Rekiy|Rekiy]] ([[User talk:Rekiy|talk]]) 02:32, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
:::::I can weigh in. The relavent code is DesertFestival OnRaceWon(int winner). If winner == 3 (i.e. it is escargo) and you don't already have the specialRewardsCollected flag it triggers the specialRewardsCollected flag, and goes to the next iteration of the loop. Importantly, this skips the check directly below for a key existing in a dictionary, and then below that incrementing it for a normal prize and adding you to the list of winning farmers. Then in CollectRacePrizes, you get the bonus if needed, and it sets it so you can't get it again until it is cleared, then proceeds to give you 20 eggs for every normal win. It does this by pulling the value from a dictionary which only exists if you get a normal prize, which is likely what causes the crash. I think it will also say that no one won. Will quickly do some testing and report back, maybe make a mod to patch away the crash. [[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 11:30, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
::::::Thank you all for the research! The bug should have been fixed with version 1.6.7 on April 28. Please be sure you are running the latest version of the game! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:16, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
:::::::I'm definitely reading 1.6.8 code, and the bug still exists. [[User:Wikonimo|Wikonimo]] ([[User talk:Wikonimo|talk]]) 18:32, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
:::::::Version 1.6.8.24119 here, according to the ? menu. Still crashing. [[User:Rekiy|Rekiy]] ([[User talk:Rekiy|talk]]) 20:56, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
::::::::The bug does still occur. I'm using 1.6.8. I don't see anything in the version history indicating this bug was fixed. SMAPI appears to prevent it crashing, but still shows it in the log. As I thought it is a System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException which occurs in StardewValley.Locations.DesertFestival.CollectRacePrizes. I have also made a simple patch which fixes it. This patch uses harmony to prefix OnRaceWon, where it iterates through the players with a winning bet and makes sure the entry exists in the collection.[[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 21:43, 27 May 2024 (UTC)
:::::::::I don't see any bug report on the forums. Please make a bug report with details and attach the save file or SMAPI log! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:24, 28 May 2024 (UTC)
::::::::::Well, it's been a full week now since the bug report (which was ''there all along'', you just missed it!) was reposted, and you still haven't restored the missing info. Pathetic. No wonder this page has so many errors. Does the rest of the wiki? How can I know? You shouldn't be in charge of vegetable peelers, let alone a website. (Speaking of which, great job on the Dyeing talk page too. Wonder how many other people you've pushed out of here?)
::::::::::You can go ahead and ban me or whatever, I'mma go play a game with an ''accurate'' wiki. [[User:Rekiy|Rekiy]] ([[User talk:Rekiy|talk]]) 11:19, 4 June 2024 (UTC)
:::::::::::The bug is already fixed in the 1.6.9 Beta and will be pushed out to the public branch as soon as the patch is ready. Bugs introduced then fixed during beta don't normally appear in version history, but you were free to re-add the information to the page at any time after the bug report was discovered or re-posted. 
:::::::::::I would remind anyone reading this that hostility is not only completely unacceptable on this wiki, but that honest communication will always go farther. 🖖 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:39, 4 June 2024 (UTC)
