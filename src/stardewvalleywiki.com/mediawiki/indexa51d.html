==Gold per day==
My edit that had shown the gold/day that crab pots make had been removed because I have to show my calculations so I will try and show it here on this talk page. Please forgive me if I am wrong because I am new to both wiki editing and I am rusty on my maths skills. I got all the information from the Stardew valley wiki.

Recycled trash items:
(For all of the recycled items that can give 1-3 items, I will be using 2 as it is the median)


Trash:
1-3 (2 Average) stone=4(sell price)*0.49(percentage to get)=1.96  1-3 coal=30*0.30=9  1-3 iron:20*0.21=4.2  1.96+9+4.2=15.16

Driftwood:
1-3 wood:4*0.75=3  1-3 coal:30*0.25=7.5  3+7.5=10.5

Newspaper:
3 torches=15*0.9=13.5  cloth=470*0.1=47  47+13.5=60.5

Both CD's and Glasses don't require calculations as they have a 100% chance to give 50g from refined quartz.

Total average for all trash items: 
15.16+10.5+60.5+50+50=186.16/5=37.232


This means that the 38% chance that a crab pot has to make trash, it will on average be worth 37.232g


Fresh fish:

Trash=37.272*0.38=14.163

Periwinkle=20*0.21=4.2

Snail=65*0.13=8.45

Crayfish=75x0.28=21

14.163+4.2+8.45+21=47.813 &lt;--Average gold/day


Salt fish:

Trash=37.272*0.38=14.163

Oyster=40*0.03=1.2

Shrimp=60*0.05=3

Mussel=30*0.14=4.2

Cockle=50*0.17=8.5

Crab=100*0.06=6

Clam=50*0.12=6

Lobster=120*0.03=3.6

14.163+12+3+4.2+8.5+6+6+3.6=46.663 &lt;--Average gold/day

The percentages on the actual chart with ocean crab pot fish only adds up to 60 so either the statement "The chance of trash appearing is 38%, regardless of luck or fishing skill" or the percentages are wrong and should total to 62% instead of just 60%. This would likely make the ocean crab pot almost identical to the fresh water crab pot profit wise. [[User:Pixelated|Pixelated]] ([[User talk:Pixelated|talk]]) 17:52, 18 June 2021 (UTC)
:Thank you Pixelated!  This is exactly what I was referring to.  I will restore the edit, but move it to its own section on the page.  Thanks again, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:03, 18 June 2021 (UTC)


:Forgot to add the gold/day for both freshwater fish and saltwater fish with mariner profession and where you turn all the fish into sashimi.

since all the fish have the same chance of appearing, salt water now becomes more profitable.

Salt average: 75+75+75+75+100+50+120=570/7=81.4


Fresh average: 75+75+75=225/3=75 [[User:Pixelated|Pixelated]] ([[User talk:Pixelated|talk]]) 19:27, 18 June 2021 (UTC)

== Order of checking crab pots ==

For the curious, the percentages on this page are incorrect.  It assumes that the code visits each crab pot in the same order as they are listed in the data file.  This isn't true: it visits them as a C# Dictionary object, for which the visitation order is undefined.

Undefined but deterministic, at least for a given build.  It's possible to back-out the order for a given build (by predicting crab pots).  For 1.5.6, the order of checking pots is:

Beach: Lobster / Crab / Oyster / Clam / Shrimp / Cockle / Mussel

Freshwater: Snail / Crayfish / Periwinkle

This theoretically could change with a new build / Dictionary implementation and *definitely* would change if more entries were added to the Data\Fish table. --unsigned comment by [[User:Mon|Mon]] ([[User talk:Mon|talk]]) 14:25, 10 January 2022

:I've been able to ascertain that the above comment refers to the % chance to catch each item in a crab pot, listed on the [[Crab Pot]] page, not the gold per day calculations listed above on this talk page.

:The original calculations, taken from the [https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/Talk:Fish#Crab_pot_percentages_inaccurate.3F old wiki's Fish talk page] are:

== Crab pot percentages inaccurate? ==

The chances of getting each type of fish add up to more than 100% - ocean varieties come to a total of 130% and freshwater 115%.  I'm not sure where the numbers were obtained, but is it possible to verify them? [[User:Vryl|Vryl]] ([[User talk:Vryl|talk]]) 20:27, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
: The crabpot percentages displayed on the page are the values from &lt;code>Data/Fish.xnb&lt;/code>.
: For Mariners, these percentages mean nothing. Each Ocean fish has 1/7 (≈{{#expr: (100/7) round 2}}%) chance to be caught, each Freshwater fish has 1/3 (≈{{#expr: (100/3) round 2}}%) chance to be caught, and junk has 0 chance to be caught.
: For non-Mariners, these numbers represent the branches of the probability tree, where each fish in sequence is only rolled for if the previous fish was not caught (i.e. Lobster is only rolled for if Clam was not caught).

:Clams are now considered fishes since 1.6, so they can get turned into sashimi. The average gold per day for Mariner is now 85G instead of 81.4G

== Calculating the gold per day ==

Hey

I wrote a program that is able to calculate the exact profit you make using crab pots. For some reason I am not allowed to post a direct link to that program. It is on github (username guslav, project StardewValleyCrabPot)

The program provides the probability trees to be printed out for a anyone to recheck the number's. 
This helped me to create the following table
{| class="wikitable"
|
! [[Skills#Fishing|Luremaster]] or no Fishing Profession 
! [[Skills#Fishing|Fisher]]
! [[Skills#Fishing|Fisher/Angler]]
! [[Skills#Fishing|Mariner]]
! [[Skills#Fishing|Fisher/Angler]] &amp; [[Skills#Fishing|Mariner]]
|- 
! Ocean
| 35.63
| 43.34
| 51.27
| 64.29
| 92.86
|- 
! Ocean + [[Sashimi]]
| 48.03
| 51.13
| 55.71
| 81.43
| 99.29
|- 
! Freshwater
| 33.04
| 41.09
| 49.36
| 53.33
| 79.67
|- 
! Freshwater + [[Sashimi]]
| 46.84
| 51.82
| 59.01
| 75.00
| 94.67
|}

the cost for bait is excluded. Rows with Sashimi assume that you turn every fish worth less then 75g into sashimi before selling. The column [[Skills#Fishing|Fisher/Angler]] &amp; [[Skills#Fishing|Mariner]] assumes that you picked Mariner as your fishing profession, collect fish for a long time in a chest and sell it all at ones when you have the Angler profession (using the statue of uncertainty). The 10.000g is excluded.

It is also assumed that you do not recycle the trash for extra profit. Otherwise you can add following extra profit:
{| class="wikitable"
|
! [[Skills#Farming|Agriculturist]] or no Farming Profession  
! [[Skills#Farming|Rancher]]
! [[Skills#Farming|Artisan]]
|- 
! Ocean
| 14.14
| 14.86
| 15.57
|- 
! Freshwater
| 13.98
| 14.69
| 15.39
|}
I would like to put these tables on the wiki replacing [[Crab Pot#Gold per Day|Gold per Day]] on the Crab Pot site.

Thank you

:I can see that you put a lot of effort into this topic! However, when I asked you to provide the calculations, I meant that you need to somehow filter out the calculations used, and type or copy/paste them to the wiki. The data needs to be verifiable without downloading and running a program.
:Please note that the calculations and any resulting numbers should be made as brief as possible -- see the above sections for examples.
:Additionally, I don't think you've fully addressed the issue of the 10,000g it costs to change professions. Readers must decide what the break-even point is for themselves. This detracts from the usefulness of the entire section. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:19, 21 January 2023 (UTC)

:: I'm ok with leaving out the column angler and mariner. 
:: Second: Why are the results different to the previous ones? The ones already published are using the probabilities from the wiki and these have only 1 significant digit. On the other hand I calculate with fraction's to avoid any rounding untill the very end. 
:: Next point show the calculations: The problem is, that the calculations are simply long. I made a subfolder on my github with the calculations. The files will show you the exact probability tree (crab pot results+recycling machine results). For example you want to see how much profit you make in Ocean, under fisher and artisan profession, without turning into sashimi and with selling recycling goods you can look into the file ''calculations/InOcean_Artisan_Fisher_NoSashimi.txt''. The file looks like this:



    You would make a profit of (184103173621/3125000000) ≈ 58.91 gold every day.
    The number can be obtained by the following probability tree. Just add the product of probability and selling value of any leaf in the tree together and you will get the number 58.91.

:::Hey Fella, if you could sign your posts with 4 tildes &lt;nowiki>~~~~&lt;/nowiki>, that would help a lot.
:::So, if you eliminate the columns involved with changing professions, the numbers are basically the same as what's on the page already. I don't think a second decimal place is particularly helpful when you're talking about such low profits. 
:::The other changes, if I have this right, are that you've added Mariner + Ocean/Freshwater without Sashimi, and separated trash recycling into a separate table that shows Farming profession differences. (Differences of 1-2 gold per day). For those changes, you need to link to huge probability tables that are located external to the wiki. 
:::I'm not sure any of that is worth the changes you're proposing. I believe the profits are so small, that one paragraph is sufficient. It gives the readers the idea that crab pots can be profitable, which is bascially the whole point. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:03, 24 January 2023 (UTC)
