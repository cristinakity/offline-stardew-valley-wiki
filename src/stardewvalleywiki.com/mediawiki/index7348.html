== User page carryover ==

I noticed a red link to [[User:Pathoschild/Modding wishlist]], which apparently wasn't carried over from [https://stardewcommunitywiki.com/User:Pathoschild/Modding_wishlist the old page] on the previous domain. Was skipping over userspace pages like this one an intentional part of the transition process, or an oversight?

I guess it might make sense for editors to personally choose what pages to keep, but it might be annoying for people with many subpages. [[User:RetroEdit|RetroEdit]] ([[User talk:RetroEdit|talk]]) 18:00, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

: Hi! I just copied all my subpages over. I'm not sure why user pages weren't transferred, but apparently there were technical/legal restrictions on what they could transfer. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 18:43, 19 February 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>

::Ah, I see.

::I would guess it's related to "And, in accordance with privacy laws, no personal information will be transferred during this move [the wiki transfer]" from [https://www.stardewvalley.net/upcoming-wiki-transfer/ ConcernedApe's blog post]. Perhaps userspace pages were considered personal information? Although, I also infer the accounts themselves were transferred over, so that seems somewhat inconsistent to me.

::But it's not directly relevant to me anyway as a new editor here. I guess I was just curious. [[User:RetroEdit|RetroEdit]] ([[User talk:RetroEdit|talk]]) 19:13, 19 February 2021 (UTC)

::: I'm not sure any user info was transferred, aside from the actual usernames. I think it might sync (some of) your user info from the old wiki the first time you login here. That might be why [[User:Pathoschild/Transfer watchlist|watchlists were reset]] for example. That's just a guess though, I don't have any internal info about the transfer. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 19:40, 19 February 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>

==Old Wiki Lifetime==
Cole informed me that the old wiki has no set lifetime, but "they" plan to keep it around as long as possible.  (I think "they" means ChuckleFish).  To me, this says that the old wiki could potentially disappear without warning at any time.  So, we can either make sure every page is archived on the wayback machine, or go with your template and archived pages.  (I choose the second option 😛)  

I've restored the admin noticeboard archive and removed the delete tag from the template.  I'm not sure we need all the Admin noticeboard history, but having the last several comments doesn't hurt.  Creating redlinks does hurt my OCD a bit, but we can deal with those over time.  Good?  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 07:05, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

: Sounds good to me! I prefer having the archives on-wiki too, and the redlinks are still useful for finding the user's edits &amp; talk page. If needed we could create a placeholder template for user pages to turn them blue, or tweak the stylesheets so links to valid-but-not-created user pages are a gentler shade of red/blue. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 07:26, 21 February 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>

==Adding CurseForge Mod Repository to list of mod sites with Stardew Valley Mods==
Referred here by MargotBean:
{{quote|Hello! revision 117428 by Gilgamsh0n ([[User talk:Gilgamsh0n|talk]]) with the reason 'I know nothing about this site.' on 01:54, 22 February 2021 (UTC)
I provided a link to the repository which has 48 SV mods, some of them unique to my knowledge (DarkHax authored mods).
would be neat if you could revert this change, CurseForge is a legit repository for mods for a variety of games, and SV mods are very welcome there!
[[User:Gilgamsh0n|Gilgamsh0n]] ([[User talk:Gilgamsh0n|talk]]) 14:55, 22 March 2021 (UTC)
:DarkMax should consider hosting their mods on nexus or the official forums in addition to the site which I still know nothing about.  Please remember to place new text at the bottom of the page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:59, 22 March 2021 (UTC)

Appologies about placing the text at the top!
What would be required for you to know more about the site, other than the fact it has mods for many games including SV? Glad to provide more info, it's by no means a small website. www.curseforge.com for your convenience.
[[User:Gilgamsh0n|Gilgamsh0n]] ([[User talk:Gilgamsh0n|talk]]) 15:28, 22 March 2021 (UTC)
:Please place a message on Pathoschild's [[User talk:Pathoschild|talk page]], he may be more familiar with the website than I am.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:59, 23 March 2021 (UTC)}}

Would be great if it could be reviewed and restored/added, happy to provide more info if you wish.
[[User:Gilgamsh0n|Gilgamsh0n]] ([[User talk:Gilgamsh0n|talk]]) 18:10, 23 March 2021 (UTC)

: Hi! Based on the [https://smapi.io/mods mod compatibility data], only 13.7% of CurseForge's SMAPI mods (i.e. nine mods by three authors) are compatible and aren't already on a more popular site. So while [[Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Update checks#Valid sites|SMAPI itself supports CurseForge]], I think it's too small and has too many broken mods to recommend to first-time players in the 'getting started' guide (especially with no way to indicate on CurseForge that a mod is broken). CurseForge mods are already listed in the [https://smapi.io/mods mod index] though, so it's still discoverable. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 19:07, 23 March 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>

==Orphaned Modding page==
'''Modding:IDE reference:JetBrains Rider''' has been a stub (and an orphaned page) since Dec. 17, 2019. Do you think it can be deleted? Or, should it be left alone? Or something else? Thank you! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:36, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

: Logically, I presume it should be integrated (or at least linked) in the [[Modding:IDE reference]] page. I would say it could be useful for people used to JetBrains' IDEs but I not aware at all if the page is up to date. -- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 18:48, 22 November 2021 (UTC)

:: We'll need to rewrite our [[Modding:IDE reference|main IDE docs]] soon, since MonoDevelop is dead and the upcoming Stardew Valley 1.5.5 will switch to .NET 5 + MonoGame on all platforms. I've been using Rider on Linux for a while now; so when I redo the docs for the 1.5.5 release, I'll switch MonoDevelop to Rider in the main guide. I guess we can keep the subpage temporarily until that happens? —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 20:59, 22 November 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>
:::Thanks so much, I'll mark it for deletion now and delete it after v1.5.5 (and the updates to the modding pages). [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:53, 23 November 2021 (UTC)

==1.5.5 hotfix link==
Small potatoes, but did you notice that the hotfix is listed at the bottom of the main blog post for the v1.5.5 release? It goes into more detail than the tweet, so I used the forum link instead of the twitter link. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 00:36, 4 December 2021 (UTC)

: Thanks! I hadn't noticed them down there. I tweaked the section to link to both; how does that look? —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 00:39, 4 December 2021 (UTC)&lt;/small>
::Looks complete, and a little bit like you may have had too much caffeine today. Pardon me while I run away fast now. ;)
::Seriously, it looks fine. Remember to take breaks now and then. XO, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 00:46, 4 December 2021 (UTC)

==Game speed==
Hey there, I noticed in an [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Day_Cycle&amp;diff=133175&amp;oldid=133132 edit to the day page] you changed the length of a day from 14:20 min (860sec) as it said previously to 14:00 (840s) and the corresponding rate of time to 0.716s to exactly 0.700s. You did point out in the edit summary that this was more accurate, so I'll take your word about that until I can set aside some time to test, but I just wanted to confirm that this was intentional because most other sources I've seen have said "about 0.7" and not exactly 0.700. Thanks in advance! [[User:Techhead7890|Techhead7890]] ([[User talk:Techhead7890|talk]]) 19:58, 22 May 2022 (UTC)

: Hi! The online info is mostly based on players experimenting in-game, which can be imprecise. The edit is based on the [[Modding:Modder Guide/Get Started#How do I decompile the game code?|decompiled game code]] instead, in particular these &lt;samp>Game1&lt;/samp> constants used in the time code:
: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
public const int realMilliSecondsPerGameMinute = 700;
public const int realMilliSecondsPerGameTenMinutes = realMilliSecondsPerGameMinute * 10;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>
: and this &lt;samp>MineShaft&lt;/samp> method for the Skull Cavern adjustment (the Skull Cavern is mine area 121, and despite the name this is the extra milliseconds per in-game ''ten minutes''):
: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
public override int getExtraMillisecondsPerInGameMinuteForThisLocation()
{
    if (Game1.IsMultiplayer)
        return base.getExtraMillisecondsPerInGameMinuteForThisLocation();
    if (this.getMineArea() != 121)
        return 0;
    return 2000;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

==v1.6 Graphic==
I had a thought: If we change the version number to v1.6 with the new code, won't we need a new graphic for the main page? ...Maybe something to discuss w/CA when the time comes. Or maybe we leave the image as is for when it rolls out to the other platforms, but eventually replace it with something without version numbers. ?? 🤔 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:20, 15 September 2022 (UTC)

: ConcernedApe might create an image for the 1.6 announcement post (like [https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-5-update-out-now-on-pc/ he did for 1.5]). If not, it'd be pretty easy to just edit out the hanging '1.5' sign, or maybe one of our pixel modders could create a new image for the wiki. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 01:35, 16 September 2022 (UTC)&lt;/small>


==Notes for Mobile Version History aren't matching up with official release notes as of build 34 onwards==
Hi - the official forum thread for mobile version 1.5 also lists the patches as they are released and these are taken directly from ConcernedApe's twitter, however you have build 34 listed on the mobile version history which doesn't match up with the January 11 patch notes, take a look here for the forum thread: https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/report-1-5-mobile-issues-here-updated-jan-11.14953/

This is going to confuse people. I see that you obtained the latest notes from a decompile. I think it would be best if the Wiki only contained the official patch notes from ConcernedApe. What's your opinion?&lt;br />—&lt;small>[[User:MrJunimo|MrJunimo]] ([[User talk:MrJunimo|talk]]) 12:27, 11 January 2023‎ (UTC)&lt;/small>

: Hi! That forum post shows release notes for 1.5.6.32/33/35, and silently skips 1.5.6.34. It's not unusual for an update to have missing or incomplete release notes, which is one of the reasons the wiki isn't just a copy &amp; paste of the official notes. It does link to the announcement (when there is one) so you can see the original release notes (if any). I added 1.5.6.35 to the wiki and asked Magically Clueless to add version numbers to her post though, which should both reduce confusion. Thanks for pointing it out! —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 17:53, 11 January 2023 (UTC)&lt;/small>



==SpriteText font not loaded when changing to custom language==
Found a bug in game code for custom language.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
'''To Reproduce'''&lt;br/>
Suppose the custom language is Thai, we want to prove Thai's SpriteText is not loaded.
# Start game with any language other than Thai.
# In language select menu, select Thai.
# Now current language is Thai.
# You find those text drawn with &lt;samp>SpriteText::drawString&lt;/samp> are gone.&lt;br/>
&lt;br/>
'''To Fix'''&lt;br/>
Add following case statement to &lt;samp>SpriteText::OnLanguageChange&lt;/samp> method's switch-case statement.
: &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
case LocalizedContentManager.LanguageCode.mod:
    SpriteText.FontFile = SpriteText.loadFont(LocalizedContentManager.CurrentModLanguage.FontFile);
    SpriteText.fontPixelZoom = LocalizedContentManager.CurrentModLanguage.FontPixelZoom;
    break;

: Hi! Would you be interested in joining the [[Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6|Stardew Valley 1.6]] alpha? Then you can propose the fix as part of 1.6, and test that it's working for you once it's done. You'll need to join the [[Modding:Community#Discord|Stardew Valley Discord]] though. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 18:54, 15 February 2023 (UTC)&lt;/small>

== Text within Wikipedia pages ==

Hello [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]], since v1.6 is now out, I feel like the Wiki needs a clean-up, and that is that the Wiki pages use capital letters for the links, they need to be lowercased to match paragraphs in proper English, unless if it's the start of a paragraph, proper nouns, bold text at the start of a page, or the name of a [[Villagers|villager]]. This will improve the language of the Wiki and make it easier to read. Please work on this Pathoschild, thank you.

: 9000, I've asked you before to stop nit-picking capitalization in a language that is not your first language. Please stop pestering other folks. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:52, 20 March 2024 (UTC)

: Hi! I wouldn't mind a discussion about capitalization, but we shouldn't make large-scale changes like that without reaching a consensus first. I mainly work on modding and technical pages though, so margotbean would be the main person to discuss general content style with. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 23:09, 20 March 2024 (UTC)&lt;/small>

:: Hello [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]], [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]] is saying that English is not my first language and says that my edits do not improve the Wiki, especially when '''changing links'''. English only uses capital letters at the start of paragraphs or proper nouns, you changed the [[Version History]] page in lowercasing links, but Margotbean didn't care about you doing it, she cares about us doing it. The Wiki is the exact opposite for the most part, it really needs to be '''matching''' paragraphs in proper English, she doesn't care about '''adding''' links, but when '''changing''' them. Also in her [[User:Margotbean|user page]], it reads ''If you need to contact me about Wiki issues, feel free to post.'' When you do that, she doesn't give a response about what you wrote to her at all. Margotbean hates me now. Please reply to her [[User talk:Margotbean|talk page]] about all of this, thank you so much.

::: I prefer lowercase too, but I don't think it's as straightforward as you suggest. An argument can be made both for treating page names as regular text (like [[Version History|version history]]) or as page titles (like [[Version History]]). There's also precedent in wiki tradition, since the earliest wikis used [[Version History|VersionHistory]] (one word with capitals) to indicate page links.

::: I also don't think it's a question of favouritism, since Margotbean and I have definitely argued and disagreed before. There's a distinction between the content articles (which use capitalized links) and technical documentation pages (which use lowercase links). The two sections of the wiki have somewhat different audiences and style conventions (e.g. technical documentation tends to prefer named links over naked links), and [[Version History]] (or [[Version History|version history]]?) falls somewhere between the two so it can go either way.

::: So I'm fine discussing the capitalization conventions, but we shouldn't just change the convention used by each section without agreeing on the changes first. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 06:12, 21 March 2024 (UTC)&lt;/small>

:::: I agree with these changes, but another thing while we're at it, the Wiki uses a '''lot''' of errors in links, which need to be fixed, for example: &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>the [[The Mines|Mines]]&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code> looks like gibberish to me, so I change it to the following coding: &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>[[the Mines]]&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code>. The capitalization of links shouldn't just be all capitals, as it makes it bad for reading, for example: &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>[[Cave Carrot]]s&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code> should look like the following: &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>[[Cave Carrot|cave carrots]]&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code>. This doesn't affect the targeted page or create a redlink, but titles it to lowercase letters instead of capital letters. Hopefully this will be changed to match proper English.

==Template changes==
I have to give you 20 lashes with a wet noodle for changing [[Template:Version]] and [[Template:Content Patcher version]] in English only. ''Someone'' has to make the changes in all 12 languages, so if it's not you, then it falls on me. In fairness to everyone else I've been chastising and correcting, I have to do the same for you. So, can you and will you make the changes in all 12 languages? Thank you in advance for your reply  👍 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:26, 1 April 2024 (UTC)

: Done! —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 21:06, 1 April 2024 (UTC)&lt;/small>

==User issue==
Could you please take a look at [[Stardew Valley Wiki:Admin noticeboard#Adding external links to Modding:Mod compatibility]] and see if you can help, or direct them to discord? Let me know if my assistance is required! Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:09, 15 April 2024 (UTC)

: Done! I replied there. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 19:37, 15 April 2024 (UTC)&lt;/small>
