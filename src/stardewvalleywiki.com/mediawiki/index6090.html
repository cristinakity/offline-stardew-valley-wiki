<dd>I'm not sure how debugOutput works, but I guess the weeds can destroy all types of objects except for weeds, stone and twig. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Horizon98" title="User:Horizon98">Horizon98</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98" title="User talk:Horizon98">talk</a>) 17:16, 23 June 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks for this. If object name <b>does not</b> contain weed, stone or twig then items of type "object2" can be destroyed, so it destroyes all object2's that are not weed, stone, twig. The only issue with this being if there are different object groups... are all objects part of the object2 group? What about fences, chests, buildings? I usually play on mobile, so I don't keep my PC handy but maybe I'll try to take a look at the decompiled code. Not sure it will make sense enough to me to determine this easily or quickly though as I've never looked at it before and am not a programmer.</dd>

<dl><dd>The game code seems to indicate that anything other than fences and chests can be destroyed. I don't know if a fully-grown fruit tree can be destroyed yet, but everything else seems vulnerable. I've updated the page in the meantime, while we do more research. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:19, 23 June 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks Margobean! Ps. It is too bad the wiki doesn't have Echo and Thanks extensions installed (both are used on wikimedia projects so should be reliably stable, echo provides notifications without having to check pages, and thanks is for sending thanks which encourages the community. I immediately went to the history to press "thanks" before remembering it is not installed here lol.&#160;:)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>There are two collections that can be affected, objects and terrain features. All objects except for fences and chests can be removed. Objects are things that are placed that cant be moved through. For terrain features, (trees, flooring, hoedirt, grass), only flooring and hoedirt can be destroyed. I can post code when not on my phone if it would be beneficial. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:BlaDe" title="User:BlaDe">BlaDe</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:BlaDe" title="User talk:BlaDe">talk</a>) 22:11, 24 June 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spring_1_instead_of_Spring_1st">Spring 1 instead of Spring 1st</span></h2>
<p>Since this page of it used to say Spring 1st made me look suspicious. Because when it comes to day numbers on this wiki, it's usually just the number instead of the placement. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:9000" title="User:9000">9000</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:9000" title="User talk:9000">talk</a>) 8:40, 16 July 2022 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="weeds_spawning">weeds spawning</span></h2>
<p>This page doesn't mention the frequency of weeds spawning in some places, so I did some tests, and here's the result:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Railroad" title="Railroad">Railroad</a>: one per year</li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mutant_Bug_Lair" title="Mutant Bug Lair">Mutant Bug Lair</a>: everyday</li>

<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines" title="The Mines">The Mines</a>: every time you enter a new level</li></ul>
<p>I'm not 100% sure about it and I don't really know how to check game codes for references, so maybe it's better to start a discussion before edit. &gt;_&lt; 
</p><p>Also, about weeds multiply and spread, the page says <i>especially on day 1 of each season, when it is raining, and during the Summer.</i> Are there any references on this?--<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Shirotsuki" title="User:Shirotsuki">Shirotsuki</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Shirotsuki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Shirotsuki (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:48, 16 July 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello Shirotsuki! The reference is already on the page, <samp>StardewValley.GameLocation::spawnWeedsAndStones</samp> produces more debris when raining and on the 1st of a season. I don't immediately see where Summer comes into the equation, however. That part may (or may not) be outdated.</dd>
<dd>Some things to keep in mind:
<ul><li>Weeds spawn in the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Railroad" title="Railroad">Railroad</a>, but the player doesn't have access to it until Summer of year 1</li>
<li>Weeds may spawn everyday in the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mutant_Bug_Lair" title="Mutant Bug Lair">Mutant Bug Lair</a>, but only a few at a time. It's not worth visiting every day, it's better to wait a few days (perhaps several days) for the weeds to build back up, if collecting <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fiber" title="Fiber">fiber</a> or other resources is the goal. Same for the jungle on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ginger_Island" title="Ginger Island">Ginger Island</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/The_Mines" title="The Mines">The Mines</a> only reset when the player exits to the top of the mines (<i>i.e.,</i> floor 0, where the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Dwarf" title="Dwarf">Dwarf</a> is).</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Hope this helps! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 00:09, 17 July 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Oh, thanks for reminding! I did forget about the earthquake. 😂 And thank you for letting me know where to find the reference!

<h2><span id="New_page_for_Large_Weeds?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="New_page_for_Large_Weeds.3F">New page for Large Weeds?</span></h2>
<p>Should we make a separate page for the large weeds spawned by the Green Rain event? I think the other resource clumps (e.g. large logs, boulders) have their own pages, but I'm hesitant to make the page since I think "Large Weed" is a player-made term, rather than a term from the game itself. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Bluestblur" title="User talk:Bluestblur">talk</a>) 16:58, 8 April 2024 (UTC)
