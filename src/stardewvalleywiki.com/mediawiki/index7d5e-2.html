== Mystic Nodes ==
The page lists "Mystic Stone" as appearing in levels 100-120 in the mines. However, I haven't been able to verify this information. Has anyone actually ever seen a Mystic Stone in the mountain mines? I know they're in the quarry and the Skull Caverns.--[[User:Rayram|Rayram]] ([[User talk:Rayram|talk]]) 11:20, 21 February 2021 (UTC)
:I have, one time, in probably 2000 hours of gameplay.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:47, 21 February 2021 (UTC)
::The chances are very slim, but the code for it has them first appearing after floor 100. MineShaft::chooseStoneType, whichStone being 46 [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 21:48, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

== How exactly do the mining professions (Miner, Geologist, Prospector, Excavator) affect these "special nodes"?  ==

How do the miner professions affect the loot obtained from following nodes?: 
&lt;br />Mystic Node 
&lt;br />Mussel Node 
&lt;br />Bone Node 
&lt;br />Clay Node 
&lt;br />Cinder Shard Node 
&lt;br />Radioactive Node 
&lt;br />--[[User:Pooiyx|pooiyx]] ([[User talk:Pooiyx|talk]]) 20:54, 23 February 2021 (UTC)

==Localized Mining Nodes Names==
Where can I find the localized mining node names? cannot find it in game files nor code, or is it made up by editors? [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 00:44, 25 March 2021 (UTC)
:Made up by editors (sometimes by me using google translate -- gasp!)  It only exists in the game code in English, unfortunately.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 00:50, 25 March 2021 (UTC)

==Blacksmith profession==
Doesn't the Blacksmith profession increase the sell price of Radioactive Bars? The note says that but it was there already before Radioactive Bars got introduced. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:51, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
:I just checked ingame and radioactive bars are not affected by the blacksmith profession. Description also states only "metal bars". [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 22:05, 16 April 2021 (UTC)

==Merge Experience and Mining Nodes tables==
I feel it confusing to have two tables with the exact same lines and just one column more in one of the two. I would argue they should be merged. I can take charge of the change if no one oppose it.
-- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 22:05, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
:I've considered condensing the tables myself, to be honest. There are a coupls of issues preventing it, though:
:#The tables don't list the exact same items; the "Experience Points" table lists rocks &amp; boulders in addition to mining nodes
:#Several pages link to the "Mining Nodes" heading on the page, which, as it is now, only contains mining nodes and not rocks or boulders
:So, the focus of the two sections is different, and the difference is pretty well engrained into the wiki. And I haven't even checked which pages might link to the "Experience Points" heading. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:06, 31 October 2021 (UTC)
::I found no reference to &lt;code>Mining#Experience Points&lt;/code> in the wiki.
::I would suggest the following:
::# Remove the Experience section
::# Create three subsections in the Mining Nodes section:
::## Experience Gain (with rephrasing; additional sentence for standard rocks and boulder, removing sentence about the sleep but link to [[Skills]] which mention it)
::## Nodes Appearance (currently at the bottom of the table; some rephrasing and adding a note about daily luck for nodes)
::## Nodes List (table, adding an experience column and adding the "dark gray rocks", maybe under the name "Stone Nodes" or "Stony Nodes")
::(Also, rock appearance and content (sometimes coal and ores) could be documented.)
::-- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 22:18, 1 November 2021 (UTC)
:::I've read your proposed changes, but because of the cascading changes that would be required in all languages, and the reasons I've stated (especially that the focus of the two sections is different), I have to say no to changing the section headings. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:04, 2 November 2021 (UTC)
::::One could argue that "mining nodes" can be understand to the act of mining itself in english, so an "experience" sub-section could fit in there, but indeed it will not fit in other languages.
::::If the issue is about keeping both sections, the table could be deleted from the Experience section, and a sentence added such as "For the precise number of points earned on each node type, see the table below".
::::-- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 19:28, 2 November 2021 (UTC)

== Experience Points for Clay Nodes? ==

I didn't find Clay Nodes in the table. Do they belong to the category of ''Any Rock (outside The Mines)''? [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 13:51, 22 July 2022 (UTC)
:I figured out you were referring to the "Experience Points" table, and they give 6XP. I've added it to the page. :) [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:59, 22 July 2022 (UTC)

== Mining Expeience from Forging? ==

I recently leveled up in mining, but I know I didn't break any rocks(Luau Festival Day). However, I did forge a couple of Iron Bars. I tried checking the mining skill page, but it only states you get XP from breaking rocks. I just wanted to see if anyone knew forging gives XP and how much for each item forged?

[[User:Highshaper|Highshaper]] ([[User talk:Highshaper|talk]]) 02:51, 7 August 2022 (UTC)
:It may have been a delayed notification from the previous day... nothing about foraging should give mining XP that I know of. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:47, 7 August 2022 (UTC)
