{{Quote|Penny lives with her mom, Pam, in a little trailer by the river. While Pam is out carousing at the saloon, Penny quietly tends to her chores in the dim, stuffy room she is forced to call home. She is shy and modest, without any grand ambitions for life other than settling in and starting a family. She likes to cook (although her skills are questionable) and read books from the local library.|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Penny''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in [[Pelican Town]]. She's one of the twelve characters available to [[Marriage|marry]]. Her [[trailer]] is just east of the center of town, west of the river. She tutors Vincent and Jas at the library.

==Schedule==
Penny can usually be found in town reading or cleaning up at the [[trailer]]. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday she tutors [[Jas]] and [[Vincent]] at the [[museum]], walking them both home afterwards. On Saturdays she'll take them to the [[Pelican Town|town playground]].

When it's raining Penny can either be found inside her [[trailer]] or visiting the [[museum]] looking at the selection of books.

After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Penny may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Penny will immediately go home to bed. Penny never visits the Resort on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, [[Festivals|Festival]] days, or her checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

==Relationships==
Penny lives with her mother [[Pam]], and she is friends with [[Maru]] and [[Sam]]. Penny dances with Sam at the [[Flower Dance]] if neither are dancing with the player.

She also teaches the local children, [[Jas]], [[Vincent]] and when he moves to [[Pelican Town]] also [[Leo]], at the [[museum]] a few days a week and accompanies them to the playground once in a while.

During the eight-heart cutscene, Vincent remarks that he once saw Sam and Penny climbing trees, at which Penny becomes visibly startled and scolds Vincent for gossiping. [[ConcernedApe]] has explained that he "wasn't trying to imply anything serious" with the scene regarding a continuation of Penny's interest in Sam. "[A]t 8 hearts...she's not actually interested in Sam anymore."&lt;ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/4b8s7v/comment/d16zqdf&lt;/ref>

==Gifts==

{{Quote|Oh! Is this for me? For... for my birthday?&lt;br>*sniff*... Sorry.&lt;br>I'm... just not used to such kindness...&lt;br>... I love it, though. It's perfect. Thank you so much.}}

For liked or neutral gifts, Penny will say
{{Quote|For my birthday? That's so nice of you! It's a great gift.}}

For disliked or hated gifts, Penny will say
{{Quote|For my birthday? That's so kind of you! Let me unwrap it...&lt;br>...What!?&lt;br>...Oh, I see. It's a cruel joke.&lt;br>Silly me, I should've known better...}}

 |details = [[George]] looks into his mailbox and wonders how he'll reach a letter in the back. Penny notices and gets the letter out for him. George is upset at being seen helpless and scolds her. Penny sees you and asks if you were watching them.
* {{choice|"I was. You did a kind thing there, Penny."|50}} Penny thanks you, but is unhappy that George was upset.
* {{choice|"I was. You should've asked instead of assuming George wanted help."|-50}} Penny apologises to George.
* {{choice|"I'm just taking a walk, minding my own business."|0}} Penny responds "I see".

Regardless of your choice, George sighs and apologises to Penny for getting angry. He says it was very kind of her to help. Penny says she understands. After George leaves, Penny says it must be difficult growing old.
* {{choice|"I'd rather not think about it."|0}} She responds, "I guess you're right... why stress out about something you can't change?"
* {{choice|"It's just a different part of life."|0}} She responds, "You're right, we shouldn't ignore the reality of aging. I guess the sooner we come to terms with our mortality, the more time we can spend really living in the here-and-now."
* {{choice|"That's why we should respect our elders."|0}} She responds, "That's nice of you to say... I totally agree with you. We should treat our elders with the same respect we hope to receive ourselves some day."

Penny bids you farewell and leaves.

I've been working so hard on this recipe, and I'm really proud of it. Hey, since you're the first person to try it, I'm going to name this one 'Chili de &lt;your name>'."
* {{choice|"Uh... can I get the rest to go?"|-50}} Penny is crestfallen and says her recipe was a failure.
* {{choice|"Well it's definitely unique... how did you get it so rubbery?"|0}} Penny is crestfallen and says her recipe was a failure.

If you agree to speak to the kids, you're prompted for a number of dialogue options (which have no effect on friendship). Afterwards Penny tells the children to run along and asks you if you'd like to be a parent.
* {{choice|"I haven't really thought about it."|0}} She responds, "Oh no? Well, I guess that makes sense... you're busy with other things right now."
* {{choice|"Absolutely. I want a big family."|20}} She responds, "... Me too. I'm glad you feel that way."
* {{choice|"I guess so. It's a natural urge."|20}} She responds, "Yes... the urge to care for something innocent and helpless. It makes sense that we'd feel that."
* {{choice|"No, I don't think I'd be good at it."|10}} She responds, "Oh, really? I think you'd make a good parent."
* {{choice|"No, The world's crowded enough already."|-10}} She responds, "hmm... If everyone thought like that, humans would die out."
* {{choice|"No, I don't want to be tied down with a family."|-10}} She responds, "Oh... That's kind of sad... but I guess I can understand your point."

==Timeline==
Penny's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Penny's style changed over the years before the game was launched.
[[File:Penny Timeline.png|center]]

==Trivia==
*At one point before the game was released, Penny was named "Dana".
*The dialogue choices for the player in Penny's 8-Heart and 10-Heart Events have the most punitive possible effect on friendship in the game, with each event having an option that will decrease friendship with her by 1500 points (equivalent to six hearts).
*The dish Penny cooks during her six heart event can be seen briefly when you eat it. It appears to be a [[Vegetable Medley]], sharing the same sprite and restoring the same amount of energy as one.
*Penny's 14-heart event can occur one time only. It will not reoccur if the player divorces her, erases her memories, and then re-marries her. The decorations not chosen by the player during the 14-heart event cannot be obtained.

==Bugs==
* If Penny's 10-heart event is seen before her other heart events, occasionally the bachelorette Group Ten-Heart Event will not trigger when entering [[2 Willow Lane|Haley &amp; Emily's house]].
* Penny's marriage schedule overrides any deviations. This means Penny will still walk home the children even if it is raining, even though the children are not there.
