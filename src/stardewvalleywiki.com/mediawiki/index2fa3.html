'''The Mines''' are located in the north area of [[the Mountain]]s (northeast of the [[Carpenter's Shop]] and to the west of the [[Adventurer's Guild]]). They are blocked by rock debris until the 5th day of [[Spring]] (Year 1), when [[the Player]] receives a letter.

==Overview==
There are 120 floors (sometimes called levels) in the Mines. Ore type and quantity increases as [[the Player]] moves deeper into the Mines. The Mines are filled with rocks and dirt patches. Rocks can be mined with a [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]] in order to obtain [[Stone]], ore, and [[Minerals#Geodes|Geodes]]. A [[Hoes|Hoe]] can be used on dirt patches to collect [[Minerals]], [[Artifacts]], ore, [[Clay]], and [[Cave Carrot]]s.

To advance deeper in the Mines, a ladder must be revealed on each floor. The ladder will appear after breaking rocks or after defeating an enemy (killing enemies is the stamina-free option to finding ladders). If a floor is "infested" or "overrun" by monsters, all enemies must be defeated on that floor before a ladder will appear. (Note, however, that there is a bug that affects very few floors where a ladder will drop before all enemies are killed.) After the player goes down a level, they will be invulnerable for 1 second.

Passing out in the Mines from exhaustion (zero [[Energy]]) or when 2:00 am arrives will result in 10% of gold lost up to a maximum of {{Price|1000}}. Passing out from drained [[Health]] will result in losing anywhere between 5%-25% of gold (up to a maximum of {{Price|15000}})&lt;ref name="minedeath" /> and also various inventory items, including [[Weapons]] and [[Tools]] (except for the [[Galaxy Sword]]). If tools are lost, they are returned in the mail on the following day, though [[Tools#Fishing Poles|Fishing Poles]] and weapons will not be returned. The player will awaken in the mine entrance, found by one of the [[villagers]].

Lost items can be recovered by contacting [[Marlon]] at the [[Adventurer's Guild]]. One lost item (or stack of items) can be purchased there, any time after passing out due to low health. The price is the base sell price of the lost item (''i.e.,'' the gold that would be obtained from selling one item or stack of items). Marlon's [[Adventurer's Guild#Item Recovery Service|Item Recovery Service]] persists until the next time the player loses items in the Mines, when previously lost items are replaced by newly lost items.

A [[Minecart]] is located on the entry floor for quick travel to and from the Mines. It is unlocked after completing the [[Bundles#Boiler Room|Boiler Room Bundles]] or by purchasing "Minecarts" from the [[Joja Community Development Form]] at [[JojaMart]] for {{Price|15000}}.

==Contents==
===Floors===
The Mines consist of 120 floors (sometimes called levels). These floors are divided into three sections, 40 floors each, with their own themes; the first section has a brown earth theme, the second section has a frozen theme, and the third and last section has a lava and dark purple theme. The last 10 floors of each section has a variation of the main theme; the first section (Floor 31-39) has a shadow theme, the second section (70-79) has a castle theme, and the third and last section (110-119) has a darker crimson theme.

The corresponding floors in each section have the same layout. For example, Floor 5, 45, and 85 have the same layout; as does 19, 59, and 99; or Floor 31, 71, and 111; and so on.

Coal Minecarts refresh their contents at the start of each year.

===Floors (dangerous)===
When the dangerous setting is active in the Mines (either from having the [[Quests#Danger In The Deep|"Danger in the Deep" Quest]] active or from toggling the [[#Shrine of Challenge|Shrine of Challenge]] on), floor theming, forage, and monsters will be different than the normal Mines. [[Slimes#Dangerous Slimes|Stacked slimes]] can appear on any level, and will be colored according to that level's normal slime color.

===Ladders===
Ladders can be dropped from Monsters&lt;ref name="laddermonsters" />, Rocks&lt;ref name="ladderrocks" />, or spawned on load&lt;ref name="ladderload" />.

After a floor loads, there is a 95% chance that a ladder will attempt to spawn. A tile is chosen at random, and if it is unobstructed then a ladder is placed. A ladder placed in this way will prevent additional ladders spawning from rocks.

Some floors are preloaded with a ladder (12, 52, 92, [[Skull Cavern#Treasure Rooms|Treasure Rooms]] in the Skull Cavern). These ladders do not prevent ladders spawning from rocks.

Every monster killed has a 15% chance of spawning a ladder, assuming the enemy was killed over an unobstructed tile. An additional 7% is added with the [[Statue Of The Dwarf King]] buff that gives greater chance to find ladders, increasing the odds from 15% to 22%.&lt;ref name="laddermonsters" /> This does not prevent ladders spawning from rocks.

Every rock destroyed has a chance to spawn a ladder, becoming more likely as there are fewer rocks remaining. If this is successful, a ladder will spawn and prevent further ladders spawning from rocks. (In contrast, in the [[Skull Cavern]], there is a 20% chance that a shaft will spawn instead of a ladder, and this does not prevent further ladders/shafts spawning from rocks.)

Specifically: Every rock destroyed has a base chance of 2% to spawn a ladder. This is adjusted by daily [[luck]], increasing by 2.5% at best (0.5% of which is added by the [[Special Charm]]) or decreasing by 2% at worst. It is also adjusted by luck [[buffs]], whether a floor has an enemy, and the [[Statue Of The Dwarf King]] buff that gives greater chance to find ladders and shafts. For example, food buffs add 1% for every point of luck. A hypothetical player with max daily luck and +1 luck buff would therefore have a 2 + 2.5 + 1 = 5.5% base chance to spawn a ladder for each rock destroyed. The inverse of the number of rocks remaining (after subtracting the rock that was just destroyed) is added on top of that (''e.g.,'' if 5 rocks remaining then 1/5 = 0.2 or 20%, if 100 rocks remaining then 1/100 = 0.01 or 1%). If no enemies remain, another 4% is added. Finally, after accounting for daily luck, luck buffs, and no enemies remaining, the Statue of the Dwarf King buff that gives greater chance to find ladders and shafts applies a 1.25 multiplier to the final odds.&lt;ref name="ladderchance" />

===Crates and Barrels===
{{Stub|Need 1.6 items added to drop pool}}
Containers in the Mines may randomly drop loot when destroyed. Containers are equally likely to be crates or barrels; the possible contents are not affected by the type of container. At most one type of item will be dropped by a crate, although one stack may contain multiple items.

Most containers respawn every time a floor is entered. At the start of each year, platform containers are refreshed.&lt;ref name="refresh" /> Containers on reward floors in the Mines, however, are only spawned the first time entering there. After those containers are destroyed, no new containers will appear on these floors.

Some items replace others depending on if the player has reached the bottom of the Mines. Where there are two values, the first is before reaching the bottom of the Mines, the second is after. The possible items found in containers and their chances are&lt;ref name="barreldrop" />:

===Special Items===
A small fraction of crates and barrels (2.2%) will drop one of the following special items&lt;ref name="specialitem" />. Visually these crates and barrels are indistinguishable from containers containing standard loot.

These special items can also be dropped by a small fraction of monsters. About 1.2% of [[Slimes]] are identifiable as [[Slimes#Special Slimes|Special Slimes]] by gold stars.  For all other monsters, less than 0.2% of monsters will drop special items instead of standard loot, but these special monsters look identical to the standard versions.

===Infested Floors===
[[File:Overrun Area.png|thumb|right|300px|Entering an infested floor]]
Occasionally the player will enter an infested floor filled with [[slimes]] or a mix of [[monsters]]. Unlike normal floors, there are no rocks and in slime-infested floors, the walls and ground are covered in green slime rather than the normal themes. [[Foraging|Forageable]] items such as [[Quartz]] or Mushrooms can still be found.

To proceed from an infested floor, all monsters must be killed (this includes [[Duggy|Duggies]] that may be hidden under dirt patches). ''Note that a bug causes the guaranteed ladder on floors 12, 52, and 92 to still appear once the floor loads even if said floor is infested.'' Once all monsters are killed, a ladder will appear either where the last monster was killed or next to the entrance. If it appears next to the entrance, the player will be notified with a message saying, "A way down has appeared". If it appears where the last monster was killed and the player does not enter the ladder immediately, after some time it is possible for a second ladder to appear near the entrance and a message notifying the player "A way down has appeared".

A [[Staircase]] can also be used to skip an infested floor.

The [[Buffs#Oil of Garlic|Oil of Garlic Buff]] prevents floors from being infested. [[Oil of Garlic]] must be consumed before entering the floor to prevent infestation.

In rare cases, there may be no monsters on an infested floor. In this case, a ladder will appear next to the entrance shortly after entering the floor, along with the message "A way down has appeared".

There is no pattern for when infested floors appear, but infested floors will remain infested for the entire day. Infested floors cannot spawn on elevator floors (floors ending in 0 or 5), nor can they spawn on the first 5 floors, the 19th floor, or the last 10 floors of each section of the Mines.&lt;ref name="loadlevel" /> This includes floors 1-4, 41-44, 81-84 (the first 5 floors), floors 19, 59, 99 (the 19th floor), and floors 31-39, 71-79, 111-119 (the last 10 floors), as well as [[Skull Cavern]] floors using the same layout as these floors.

With these spawning rules in mind, infested floors can spawn on the following floors of the Mines: 6-9, 11-14, 16-18, 21-24, 26-29, 46-49, 51-54, 56-58, 61-64, 66-69, 86-89, 91-94, 96-98, 101-104, 106-109.

Repeatedly visiting infested floors can be an excellent way to quickly achieve some of the [[Adventurer's Guild#Monster Eradication Goals|Monster Eradication Goals]] at the [[Adventurer's Guild]].

===The Mushroom Floor===
[[File:The Mushroom Floor.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A mushroom floor]]
Any floor in the lowest section of the Mines (floors 81-119), excluding elevator floors, has a 3.5% chance of generating as a mushroom floor, provided the same floor hasn't been generated as a mushroom floor before on the same day.&lt;ref name="mushfloor" />

Mushroom floors will have greatly increased spawns of [[Red Mushroom|red]] and [[Purple Mushroom|purple mushrooms]] and a greatly reduced amount of rocks, including [[Mining#Mining Nodes|ore nodes]]. These floors will also have a variety of colored lanterns which usually includes at least one green lantern.

The mushroom floor will only spawn the first time a player visits the floor and will disappear immediately after leaving it.

===Dungeon Floors===
[[File:DungeonFloor.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A dungeon floor]]
Dungeon floors are a type of floor similar in appearance to the single floor of the [[Quarry Mine]]. Any eligible floor in the Mines has a 4.4% chance of generating as a dungeon floor after the [[Quarry Mine]] has been unlocked.&lt;ref name="loadlevel" /> These floors have the same enemies and rocks as the Quarry Mine and can often be considerably harder than those of the floors they replace. Dungeon floors are never infested.&lt;ref name="loadlevel" />

In [[#Shrine of Challenge|the Dangerous Mines]], dungeon floors can spawn as long as the player has unlocked the [[Quarry Mine]]. Dangerous dungeon floors spawn [[Slimes#Dangerous Slimes|Dangerous Slimes]] instead of Copper and Iron Slimes, and the slimes are the color corresponding to that section of the Dangerous Mines. [[Haunted Skull (dangerous)|Dangerous Haunted Skulls]] spawn instead of [[Haunted Skull]]s, just like on floors 71-79 of the Dangerous Mines. While rocks mainly spawn the same as for the [[Quarry Mine]], there is also a chance for [[Mining#Radioactive Node|Radioactive Nodes]] to spawn on these floors.

As with infested floors, dungeon floors cannot spawn on elevator floors or the first floor. They will also remain as dungeon floors for the entire day. However, unlike infested floors, dungeon floors can spawn on floors 2-4, 19, and 31-39, 42-44, 59, and 71-79, 82-84, 99, and 111-119 (excluding floors 35, 75, and 115, as they are elevator floors).

Players without high-level tools or weapons might benefit from using a [[Staircase]] to skip these floors to save time.

===The Bottom of the Mines===
On floor 120 of the Mines is the [[Skull Key]]. The skull key is used to open a door in a cave in [[the Desert]], leading to the [[Skull Cavern]]. It is also used to unlock the [[Junimo Kart]] arcade machine for play in [[the Stardrop Saloon]].

Furthermore, reaching this floor also changes other parts of the game:
* [[Prismatic Shard]]s and [[Diamond]]s can now rarely drop from any [[Monsters|monster]];
* [[Minerals#Gems|Gems]] may be found when searching [[Garbage Can]]s;
* Gems may be requested on the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|Help Wanted]] board outside Pierre's General Store;
* Regardless of the floor, [[Mining#Gem Node|Gem nodes]] can drop any of the following gems: [[Emerald]], [[Aquamarine]], [[Ruby]], [[Amethyst]], [[Topaz]], and [[Jade]];
** Prior to reaching the bottom, [[Mining#Gem Node|gem nodes]] between floors 1 - 39 and 41 - 79 drop specific gems.&lt;ref name="ladderrocks" />
*** Floors 1 - 39: [[Amethyst]] or [[Topaz]]
*** Floors 41 - 79: [[Amethyst]], [[Topaz]], [[Jade]], or [[Aquamarine]]
* Most [[monsters]] will be stronger.&lt;ref name="buffedmonsters" /> Specifically:
** [[Defense]] will be increased by 50%.
** Chance of missing a hit (''i.e.,'' doing no damage with a hit) will be doubled.
** HP will be increased by a random value between 0 and 100%.
** Damage will be increased by a random value between 0 and 50%.
* Twenty different 'alternate' mine floor layouts can start appearing.

These changes are permanent, and will not reset even if the "[[Quests#Danger In The Deep|Danger In The Deep]]" quest is active (which resets the mine elevator).

===Shrine of Challenge===
[[File:Shrine of Challenge 1.png|thumb|right|180px|The Shrine of Challenge]]
The Shrine of Challenge is unlocked after unlocking [[Qi's Walnut Room]] and completing the "[[Quests#Danger In The Deep|Danger In The Deep]]" quest. It is located on floor 120 of the Mines and acts as a toggle switch, alternating the strengths of enemies between normal variants and "dangerous" variants. ''The toggle does not change monster variants until the following day.''

While the dangerous setting is active, [[Mining#Radioactive Node|Radioactive Nodes]] can be found in the Mines, from which [[Radioactive Ore]]s can be obtained.

On the day the player first completes the "Danger In The Deep" quest, a note from Mr. Qi can be found on the shrine saying he has temporarily disabled the shrine and the player can come back tomorrow.

===Difficulty Levels===
The mines can be made dangerous in one of two ways. One is through the "[[Quests#Danger In The Deep|Danger In The Deep]]" quest, and the other is using the Shrine of Challenge (above). These effects can stack. If neither of these are active, the difficulty level is 0. If one, but not both are active then the difficulty level is 1. If both are active, the difficulty level is 2.

While this mainly acts as a toggle between the normal Mines (difficulty 0) and the "dangerous" Mines (difficulty > 0); there are some effects which stack. Specifically having both active at once will increases the chances of:
* Finding [[Radioactive Ore]];
* [[Monsters]] spawning;
* [[Slimes#Dangerous Slimes|Slimes]] spawning as stacked slimes;
* [[Spider]]s having partners (making more spiders spawn);
* Defeated monsters dropping [[Diamond]]s and [[Prismatic Shard]]s.

This stacked difficulty also increases the buff to monsters (more damage, more health, more resilience), making the Mines more challenging.

==Strategy==
===Swarms===
If the screen becomes "misty", "glowy", or "foggy", several of the current floor's flying monsters will spawn and attack. Consuming [[Oil of Garlic]] will prevent these infestation fogs.

===Staircases===
If [[the Player]] has reached at least [[Mining]] skill level 2, floors can be skipped by using [[Staircase]]s (crafted from 99 [[Stone]]). A staircase allows instant access to the next floor in the Mines. After every 5 floors, an elevator will be available, allowing access to that floor at any time.

===Food===
Shown below are foods with [[Buffs]] that are useful when exploring the [[Skull Cavern]]. Note that eating a food with buffs will wipe out any active buffs and replace them with the buffs from the newly eaten food. If the newly eaten food has no buffs, the existing buffs will remain in effect. [[Coffee]], [[Triple Shot Espresso]] and [[Ginger Ale]] are an exception to this rule; they will stack with other food Buffs (but not each other).

==Bugs==
*An infested floor on floors 12, 52, or 92 at the Mines (floors preloaded with a ladder) will still have the ladder preloaded. This makes it possible to descend from that floor without killing all of the enemies or using a staircase. Killing all of the enemies on the floor will result in a second ladder spawning.

==Trivia==
* The [[Axes|axe]], [[scythe]], or [[Pickaxes|pickaxe]] can be used to kill [[monsters]] in lieu of a weapon.
* Stone can be purchased from the [[Carpenter's Shop]] for {{Price|20}} each during Year 1, making it possible to skip all 120 floors using [[Staircase]]s for just under {{Price|225000}} (useful for unlocking all the floors in order to return later).
**Starting in Year 2, the price of stone increases to {{Price|100}}, making this a much more expensive technique ({{Price|1125000}}).
**[[Monsters]] become more difficult to kill with increased damage after reaching the bottom of the Mines,&lt;ref name="buffedmonsters" /> so this technique is not without penalties.
* If all monsters on a floor are killed, the chance of finding a ladder under a broken rock is increased by 4%.&lt;ref name="ladderchance" />
* At floor 120, both the [[Green Serpent Statue]] and the [[Purple Serpent Statue]] are found.

==History==
{{History|1.3.27|Removed exploit that created a ladder to the [[Skull Cavern]] on floor 120 by blowing up an item with a [[Crafting#Bombs|bomb]]. Added several changes that happen after reaching the bottom of the Mines, specifically rare [[Prismatic Shard|prismatic shard]]/[[diamond]] now rarely drop from any [[Monsters|monster]], [[Minerals#Gems|gems]]/[[Purple Mushroom|purple mushrooms]] are now found in [[Garbage Can|garbage cans]] and can be requested by NPC quests, and some monsters becoming stronger.}}
{{History|1.4|Added random [[#Dungeon Floors|dungeon]] (quarry mine) floors. Changed the way [[#The Mushroom Floor|mushroom floors]] are spawned, so they cannot be repeatedly "farmed". Removed exploit where clicking the journal icon would prevent the passing out (from low [[health]]) cutscene where items and [[gold]] were lost. Mine floors are no longer forgotten when passing out due to low health. Added [[Marlon]]'s [[Adventurer's Guild#Item Recovery Service|Item Recovery Service]]. Mine floors now also reset as soon as the player returns to floor 0, instead of only the next 10-minute tick of the game clock when on a lower numbered floor.}}
{{History|1.5|In the Advanced Options when starting a farm, there is an option for Mine Rewards to be Default or Remixed. Added the [[#Shrine of Challenge|Shrine of Challenge]] to floor 120 after completing [[Quests#List of Mr. Qi's Special Orders|Qi quest]].}}
{{History|1.5.5|Fixed issue where the harder Mines could be permanently enabled and be unable to change back.}}
{{History|1.6|Added a [[Slimes|Gold Slime]] that drops gold when killed. Raised maximum Death Penalty from {{Price|5000}} to {{Price|15000}}.}}
{{History|1.6.4|Added 20 new 'alternate' mine layouts (excluding the Quarry mine layout), which can start appearing after reaching the bottom of the Mines. Going down a level in the mines now makes the player invulnerable for 1 second. Players can no longer gain [[Desert Festival#Skull Cavern|Calico Egg Rating]] in the normal mines. Mine barrels, coal carts, and Floors 45 and 85 will now "refresh" at the start of each year.}}
{{History|1.6.5|Fixed crash when loading dark mine levels in some cases.}}
{{History|1.6.6|“Minecart depot” alternative layout now only appears in the upper (Floors 1-39) or lava (Floors 81-119) mine areas.}}
