== Friendship Increases At Festivals ==

The article section for this topic is unchanged since SV v1.4 and does not mention Leo, either to include or exclude him from the lists. So, I would assume he's like Kent, in that he gets no friendship boost from the Luau until we've met him in play, so we have to get to Ginger Island before we can. But is he considered a villager before he's moved to town, before the player has 6 hearts with him? When is he actually eligible for the Luau boost? [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 23:08, 10 April 2021 (UTC)
:It's same with Sandy until he moves to the mainland: you don't get any friendship if the ''villager'' is not in town/at Luau festival. I didn't look in the gamecode but am very sure that I have '''not''' gained any friendship when having 5 hearts with Leo (perfect Gouverneur reaction, Iridium goat cheese in soup). I'm not exactly sure if he gets + friendship after moving to the mainland, but I'm quite sure^.^ [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:57, 12 April 2021 (UTC)
::Thanks, it's a good start. First revision for writing. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 15:48, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
::BTW, Leo's response to the Luau (or not) requires yet another definition of what "villager" means. Be careful in the writing, because it's another deviation from the Wiki-standard definition from the categories listed on the [[Villagers]] page. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 17:13, 13 April 2021 (UTC)

==Requesting clarification on effect of no-star gift on friendship==
1)the wiki states that "Note that a no-star loved item always gives more points than an iridium-star liked item." 
2)The equation is Event Multiplier × Preference × Quality Multiplier
But the equation given seems to show that stared items have a quality Multiplier which gives an additional percentage points (50% in case of Iridium quality item.)

Problem: Point 2 seems to invalidate point 1. Either there is some explanation missing(which we need to add) or we need to remove the Point 1. [[User:Tedr|Tedr]] ([[User talk:Tedr|talk]]) 05:23, 3 November 2021 (UTC)
: I have used the Stardew Checkup utility to test this and this is the result.My test NPC is Lewis. He loves Hot pepper(starred item) and glazed yam(no-star item).
::output of stardew utility | my note 
::Lewis: Friendly, 6♥ (1521 pts) -- need 979 more| starting point
::Lewis: Friendly, 8♥ (2161 pts) -- need 339 more| result of gifted glazed yam a no-star item received 640 friendship point
::Lewis: Friendly, 9♥ (2321 pts) -- need 179 more| result of gifted gold star hot pepper received 800 friendship point.

:This seems to prove that statement 1 is false.("Note that a no-star loved item always gives more points than an iridium-star liked item." )
::It took me a minute to understand your point, but I see that with Event Multipliers added into the equation, the first statement was false. I've corrected  it now. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 08:10, 3 November 2021 (UTC)
::: I did not expect this quick response, but thanks. It seems I had a little misunderstanding, and so I had to go and built up an actual table to satisfy my self. So here it is. As english is not my native tongue, I think putting numbers on it made me understand it better and help convey my meaning much clearer. Sorry for the wordy yet unclear description before.[[User:Tedr|Tedr]] ([[User talk:Tedr|talk]]) 13:17, 3 November 2021 (UTC)

::::The quality multiplier is only affected by loved and liked gifts, so neutral gifts will always give the same friendship points no matter its quality. Also, I believe that if a friendship number is a decimal (not a whole number), the friendship points will get truncated down.

== Half friendship reward for gifts to spouses? ==

So I found this code from &lt;code>NPC::receiveGift&lt;/code>:
&lt;pre>
if (this.getSpouse() != null &amp;&amp; this.getSpouse().Equals(giver)) {
    friendshipChangeMultiplier /= 2f;
}
&lt;/pre>
This is mentioned nowhere in the page. Should this be added? - [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 09:47, 11 August 2022 (UTC)
:A quick test shows the game behavior matches what I read from code. I'll add that to the page. - [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 10:01, 11 August 2022 (UTC)

==Penny suggested beer==
After 6 years and thousands of hours of gameplay, I got a dialogue from Penny stating that I could really make Pam happy if I gave her beer. This should be prevented by code in &lt;samp>NPC::loadCurrentDialogue()&lt;/samp>. I was playing Steam v1.5.6 (hotfix #3) with SMAPI, using mods "Content Patcher", "Data Layers", "Debug Mode", "CJB Cheats Menu", "CJB Item Spawner", "Chests Anywhere", and "NPC Map locations". I've never used debug mode, and never changed the default settings.

If anyone else encounters this, please be so kind as to give details! It's such a weird, rare occurrence, I'm not going to add it as a bug, but it does have me curious about how it could happen. Thanks very much,. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:01, 14 January 2023 (UTC)

== Foraged Plants as item category ==

When looking over Leah, Harvey, and Linus's gift preferences, I noticed most townsfolk seem to feel the same way about most foraged plants (the ones specifically classified as Forage, as opposed to Flower or Fruit).

My suggestion would be to change the [[Forage]] article from a redirect to [[Foraging]] to a list of items classified as Forage, same as [[Fruits]] or [[Vegetables]], and instead replace the full lists of foraged plants in gift preferences with "All Foraged Plants (exceptions listed here)" where applicable, same way we do with All Fruits. 

You can see how this would change [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Leah&amp;curid=264&amp;diff=150132&amp;oldid=150045 Leah], [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Harvey&amp;curid=259&amp;diff=150131&amp;oldid=150063 Harvey], and [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Linus&amp;curid=283&amp;diff=150133&amp;oldid=148757 Linus]'s articles in the linked diffs. I feel it is much simpler than listing each Forage plant individually. - [[User:Starfarmer|Starfarmer]] ([[User talk:Starfarmer|talk]]) 19:25, 14 September 2023 (UTC)

== Item-specific gift dialogue ==

1.6 introduced many unique lines of dialogue for specific gifts. Currently, these quotes are being added to the villager pages in two different ways: at the top of each subsection (love/like/neutral/etc) just after their general response, or in a separate list at the end of the gifting section.

Personally, I prefer putting the unique dialog at the end. The actual list of gift reactions is the most important information, and having a wall of quotes ahead of each table reduces readability. Either way, it could also do with an "expand" wrapper. [[User:Scarecrow|Scarecrow]] ([[User talk:Scarecrow|talk]]) 16:35, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

:Putting the unique dialogue at the end pretty much ensures nobody is ever going to know it's there because of how hard it is to find, as indicated by, for example, someone accidentally duplicating Shane's unique gift reaction to the Strange Bun yesterday. Furthermore, anyone can easily see the list of gifts for each category from the table which is as clear as day regardless of the content around it. So readability is not reduced. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 16:42, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

:: Yes, I agree on that point. Although, I do think if someone is scrolling between one table and another to compare loved/liked gifts, a long list of quotes does get in the way. Which is why I think it's a good idea to put the quotes in an expandable section if the list becomes too long.

:: Looking at some of the pages now, there don't seem to be as many quotes listed as I remembered. So I guess it's not really a problem right now. [[User:Scarecrow|Scarecrow]] ([[User talk:Scarecrow|talk]]) 17:19, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
