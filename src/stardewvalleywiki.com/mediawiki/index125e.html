{{Quote|Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?'|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}
'''Alex''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in the house southeast of [[Pierre's General Store]]. He's one of the twelve characters available to [[Marriage|marry]]. 

==Schedule==
During [[Spring]] and [[Fall]], Alex exits his home at 8am unless it is raining. He stands by the tree to the right of his house, playing with his gridball, and he moves towards the left of the fenced-in area in the afternoon.

During [[Summer]], he can be found on [[The Beach|the beach]] in the morning and running the [[Ice Cream Stand]] to the left of the [[Museum|museum]] in the afternoon. On the 16th of [[Summer]], he has an appointment at the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]].

During [[Winter]], he works out at the [[Spa]] almost every day. When he is not there, he will be at his house.

After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on [[Ginger Island]] is unlocked, Alex may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Alex will immediately go home to bed. Alex never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or his checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Shown below are Alex's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others below it.

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 2

 |trigger = On a sunny [[Summer]] day, visit [[the Beach]] when Alex is there.
 |details = You see Alex with his gridball. He greets you and tries to toss you the gridball. You fail to catch it. He laughs and says it was a nice try. He goes on to tell you he's sure that he's going to become the first professional gridball player from Stardew Valley. He asks you what you think his chances are.

* {{choice|"I believe in you!"|0}} Alex thanks you for your support and says that he'll remember it.
* {{choice|"Wow, you're really arrogant."|0}} Alex says you're just a little jealous and leaves.
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 4
 |trigger = Enter town between 9am and 4pm.
 |details = Alex is next to the dog pen near his home. He's talking to the dog, whose name is revealed as [[Dusty]]. He comments that both he and the dog have been through a lot and that he feels misunderstood. You come out from behind the [[The Stardrop Saloon|Saloon]], and Alex asks if you heard any of that.

* {{choice|"Yes, I heard everything."|0}}
* {{choice|"Not really... why?"|0}}

Either way, he says the reason that he lives with his grandparents is because of his dad. His dad was an alcoholic and would verbally abuse Alex, calling him "worthless". One day, his dad left, and shortly after that, his mother got sick and passed away. Alex goes on to say that he shouldn't dwell on it and doesn't need sympathy. Trying to lighten the mood, Alex offers you the opportunity to see what [[Dusty]] will do for a barbecued steak.
}}

===Five Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 5
 |trigger = Enter Alex's house when he's there.
 |details = You approach him while he stares at his bookcase and laments the fact that he hasn't read a single book in it. He tells you that he's worried he won't get anywhere in life without being knowledgeable and that he feels worthless.

* {{choice|"That's crazy. You're a genius!"|0}}
* {{choice|"We all have our strengths and weaknesses."|50}}
* {{choice|"Worthless? Yeah, that about sums it up."|-50}}

He decides that if he works hard, he can accomplish anything. He suggests that you and he can have dinner and discuss philosophy.
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Enter Alex's house when he's there.
 |details = Alex expresses doubt about being able to go pro as a gridball player. He apologizes to you for acting rude and arrogant and appreciates how you stuck with him despite all that. You provide some encouragement (no choices necessary), and Alex will return to his strength workout with renewed vigor. 
}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = On a sunny day, visit [[the Beach]] when Alex is there. He is only scheduled to go to the beach in [[Summer]], but may pass by on the way to the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Ginger Island resort]] in any season after it is completed.
 |details = Alex is sitting on the beach crying. You approach him and sit down next to him. He says today is the day that his mother died 12 years ago. He regrets not being able to thank her for taking care of him when he was a kid. The only keepsake he has left is his mother's music box. Alex opens it and plays it for the both of you. As the music plays, you see a vision of Alex's mother happily cradling baby Alex in her arms. As the music fades, he asks what you're thinking.

* {{choice|"Honor your mother's memory by always doing your best."|0}} Alex agrees and says that's why he's working so hard to be a professional gridball player.
* {{choice|"You shouldn't dwell in the past."|0}}
* {{choice|"I'll always be here for you if you get lonely."|0}} Alex thanks you and bashfully says you're his best friend in the whole town. If male, he says "You... you're different than other guys. More sensitive. I'm glad."
* {{choice|"Get over it. Life is hard for everyone."|0}}

After calming down, he says the two of you should head back to town. Before you leave, he nervously asks you not to tell anybody that he was crying. You laugh and walk off while he hurriedly chases after you.
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = Alex will send you a letter to meet him at [[The Stardrop Saloon|the Saloon]] after dark. After receiving the letter, enter [[The Stardrop Saloon|the Saloon]] between 7pm and 10pm.
 |details = Alex reserves a private room for your dinner date. [[Gus]] plays the violin for you two, and [[Emily]] will bring in your food.

If the player is female, Alex confesses that he has had a crush on you since the two of you first met, and although his crushes in the past faded away quickly, his feelings for you kept growing. If the player is male, Alex confesses that he has been drawn to you since the two of you first met; although he denied these feelings at first, he's now decided to follow his heart.

* {{choice|"I feel the same way."|0}} Alex is elated that the both of you were finally able to admit your feelings to each other. He happily digs into his steak. [[Dusty]] suddenly bursts through the window, salivating at the smell of food. Alex laughs.
* {{choice|"I'm sorry... I don't feel that way about you."|0}} Alex is crushed and apologizes for making you uncomfortable. He loses his appetite.
}}

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|boys}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger = Exit the [[Farmhouse]] in year 2+ between 6am and 8:20am on any day other than Sunday.  You must have {{Price|5000}} available.
 |details = Alex will stop you and ask for {{Price|5000}} for a 'secret project'. If you accept, he will remark that it will be ready to be seen on Sunday. 

Part 2 can be triggered by entering the [[The Stardrop Saloon|Saloon]] the following Sunday. Alex, [[Kent]], [[Shane]], [[George]], and [[Gus]] can be seen watching a gridball game in the backroom, half of which has been decorated with gridball memorabilia and a TV. The other half still has barrels, and storage. The player walks in, and Alex tells the player that although his dream of going pro may not have been realised (though he assures the farmer that he's happy with his life now), this is a small way of realising it. Kent adds that it takes his mind off things, and Shane agrees. Gus tells the player that watching the game is good for business, too. The cutscene ends with the player saying that the guys have a new tradition now and that the {{Price|5000}} was well spent.

[[File:AlexGridball.jpeg]]
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Alex will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also setup a workout space behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to lift weights.

On rainy nights, Alex may offer you dinner:  [[Survival Burger]], [[Dish O' The Sea]], [[Fried Eel]], [[Crispy Bass]], or [[Baked Fish]].  On days when he stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may make you breakfast:  [[Omelet]], [[Hashbrowns]], or [[Pancakes]].

==Timeline==
Alex's look evolved over the years the game was in development.  Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Alex's style changed over the years before the game was launched.
[[File:Alex Timeline.png|center]]

==Trivia==
*At one point before the game was released, Alex was named "Josh".
*In the picture of Alex holding a gridball, only four fingers are drawn on his hand. All other characters in Stardew Valley with visible hands (excluding [[Clint]]) are drawn with five fingers.
*It is possible to trigger Alex's eight-heart in any season after repairing [[Fish Shop#Willy's Boat|Willy's Boat]] if you follow him on his way to [[Ginger Island|Ginger Island]].	
* On days when he stays inside the farmhouse all day, and he offers you breakfast, two out of three of the possible breakfasts are an ingredient in one of his loved gifts, [[Complete Breakfast]]. This is an easy way to quickly increase friendship with him once married.
