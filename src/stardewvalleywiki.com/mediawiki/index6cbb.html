[[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]] will send the player a letter in advance of each festival, describing when and where it will take place. On the day of the festival, a pop-up on left-hand side of the screen will let the player know when the festival has begun. If they choose to attend a festival (other than the [[Night Market]] or [[Desert Festival]]), upon leaving they will be returned to [[the Farm]] late at night.

If it is a festival day other than the [[Desert Festival]], [[Trout Derby]], [[SquidFest]], or [[Night Market]] animals do not need to be fed; the game will automatically consider them fed.

Attendance at festivals is entirely optional. Speaking to villagers at festivals will increase friendship points, the same as any other day. Some festivals can have special effects on friendship, such as increasing friendship with every known villager, or increased friendship for gifting.

In a [[multiplayer]] game, every player who is present needs to enter the festival area to proceed (except for the [[Night Market]]). The same goes for leaving it, if it doesn't end automatically. Generally, only the host can initiate further events.

==Shop Closures==
{{Main article|Shop Schedules}}
All buildings and homes in Stardew Valley are "locked" on all festival days where the festival begins before 7pm (''i.e.,'' all festivals other than [[Spirit's Eve]] and [[Dance of the Moonlight Jellies]]). These buildings remain locked all day, even if the player does not attend the festival. [[The Sewers]], [[Community Center]], [[Movie Theater]], and [[Spa]] will remain open. The exceptions to this rule are the [[Desert Festival]], [[Night Market]], [[Trout Derby]], and [[SquidFest]], where homes and shops are open, and time continues to pass during the festivals.

==[[Spring]]==
===Egg Festival===
[[File:Egg Festival.png|thumb|right|Egg Festival]]
{{Main article|Egg Festival}}
The Egg Festival takes place on the 13th of every [[Spring]]. The player attends the festival by entering [[Pelican Town]] Square between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm. 

The featured attraction of the Egg Festival is the Egg Hunt, which begins when the player tells Lewis to start. The player and some other villagers search for small colored eggs hidden around Pelican Town. The Egg Hunt starts by talking to [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]]. The player must gather 9 colored eggs (in 50 seconds, real time), or else [[Abigail]] will win. (In multiplayer games, less than 9 eggs are required to win, and more than one player can win at the same time.) If they win, they will receive a [[Straw Hat]] as a reward the first year they win, and a [[Prize Ticket]] afterwards.

There is a booth set up where the player can purchase a decorative [[Lawn Flamingo]], [[Plush Bunny]], [[Seasonal Plant]]s, [[Strawberry Seeds]], and other items. (Planting the strawberry seeds on or before Spring 16, will allow the player to harvest [[Strawberry|Strawberries]] two times before [[Summer]]).

The festival ends after Mayor Lewis announces the winner of the Egg Hunt.

===Desert Festival===
[[File:Desert Festival.png|thumb|right|Desert Festival]]
{{Main article|Desert Festival}}
The Desert Festival takes place in the Desert during Spring 15-17, from 10am to 2am. The player does not need to wait for Pam to arrive at the [[Bus Stop]] to visit the Desert for the first two days of the festival. There are various rotating stock shops, a race to bet on, challenges to complete for event currency, and a daily opportunity to receive a new outfit from Emily. 

Time passes during the festival. However, villagers will not be at their homes or shops as they will be at the festival.

===Flower Dance===
[[File:Flower Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Flower Dance]]
{{Main article|Flower Dance}}
The Flower Dance event takes place on the 24th of every [[Spring]]. The player attends the dance by entering [[Cindersap Forest]] between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.  

The dance takes place in the far west of the forest, across the bridge that is south of the [[Wizard's Tower]]. This area is accessible only during the Flower Dance.

There is a booth set up where the player can purchase a [[Dandelion]], [[Daffodil]], [[Tub o' Flowers]], [[Seasonal Decor]], [[Seasonal Plant]]s, [[Scarecrow#Rarecrows|Rarecrow #5]], and other items.

During this festival, the player can dance with one of the [[Marriage#Marriage Candidates|bachelors or bachelorettes]], or another player in [[multiplayer]]. They must talk to them (twice) and invite them to dance, but they will refuse unless the player has at least four hearts of [[friendship]] with them. The player can talk to the other villagers and they will have event-related dialogue.

Dancing will increase friendship with their partner by 1 heart (250 points). The dance begins after talking to [[Lewis]]. The festival ends after the dance is performed.

==[[Summer]]==
===Luau===
[[File:Luau.png|thumb|right|Luau]]
{{Main article|Luau}}

The Luau takes place on the 11th of every [[Summer]]. The player attends the Luau by entering [[The Beach]] between 9am and 2pm. When the Luau ends, the player is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.

A central feature of the Luau is the potluck soup. Villagers bring different ingredients to prepare this soup for the [[Governor]], who tastes and judges it. The soup-tasting begins by talking to [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]].

Depending upon the type and quality of the ingredients the player supplies for the soup, there will be different reactions from the Governor and Mayor Lewis. The outcome may increase or reduce friendship points with all villagers.

The Luau ends automatically after the Governor tastes the soup.

===Trout Derby===
[[File:Trout Derby.png|thumb|right|Trout Derby]]
{{Main article|Trout Derby}}
The Trout Derby takes place during Summer 20-21 in [[Cindersap Forest]] near the river below [[Marnie's Ranch]]. It starts at 6:10am and ends at 2am. Players can catch [[Rainbow Trout]] all day long in the Cindersap Forest river. Each Rainbow Trout caught has a chance to give a Golden Tag.

Golden Tags can be exchanged for prizes at the [[Trout Derby#Derby Booth|derby booth]]. Prizes include the [[Tent Kit]], the [[Bucket Hat]], and the [[Mounted Trout]].

Shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the Trout Derby and time continues to pass during the festival.

===Dance of the Moonlight Jellies===
[[File:Dance Of The Moonlight Jellies.jpg|thumb|right|Dance of the Moonlight Jellies]]
{{Main article|Dance of the Moonlight Jellies}}
The Dance of the Moonlight Jellies takes place on the 28th of every [[Summer]]. The player enters the festival by entering [[The Beach]] between 10pm and 12am. When the festival ends, the player is returned to [[The Farm]] at 12am.

During the festival, villagers gather at the docks to watch migrating jellyfish who are attracted to the light of a torch that [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]] lights. Talk to Mayor Lewis to begin the festival.

The festival ends automatically after watching the jellyfish.

==[[Fall]]==
===Stardew Valley Fair===
[[File:StardewValleyFair.png|thumb|right|Stardew Valley Fair]]
{{Main article|Stardew Valley Fair}}
The Stardew Valley Fair takes place on the 16th of [[Fall]] every year. The player attends the fair by entering [[Pelican Town]] between 9am and 3pm, and upon leaving the festival, is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.

There are several games where the player can gain Star Tokens, a currency that can be exchanged for prizes at the Shop near the entrance to the [[Bus Stop]].

The Fair also has a Grange Display contest where the player can show the products of the farm and gain Star Tokens. Talking to [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]] after completing the Grange Display initiates the judging process. Once the items have been judged the player is notified and can return to Mayor Lewis to collect the results. Items displayed in the Grange Display are returned, but not automatically. If a player forgets to collect the items, they can be found in the lost and found box in the [[Mayor's Manor]].

During the Fair, the player can eat [[Survival Burger]]s cooked by [[Gus]] north of [[Pierre's General Store]] for free.

The festival ends when the player leaves Pelican Town.

===Spirit's Eve===
[[File:Spirits Eve.png|thumb|right|Spirit's Eve]]
{{Main article|Spirit's Eve}}
The Spirit's Eve festival takes place on the 27th of [[Fall]] every year. The player enters the festival by entering [[Pelican Town]] between 10pm and 11:50pm, and upon leaving the festival, is returned to [[The Farm]] at 12am. 

The festival features a maze where it is possible to obtain the [[Golden Pumpkin]] on odd years and a [[Prize Ticket]] on even years. [[Pierre]] has a shopping booth where the player can purchase festive items including a [[Scarecrow#Rarecrows|Rarecrow]], [[Jack-O-Lantern]], the Jack-O-Lantern recipe, and other items.

The maze is located to the north of Pierre's festive shop. The maze has few dead ends and progresses in a nearly linear fashion. There is no time limit to complete the maze. Towards the end of the maze, in the northwest corner of the map, walk through a block of hedges to the left of a wooden sign with a question mark. Once through, go north through an open cavern and continue east to get to the Golden Pumpkin.

The festival ends when the player leaves Pelican Town.

==[[Winter]]==
===Festival of Ice===
[[File:Festival of Ice 2.jpg|thumb|right|Festival of Ice]]
{{Main article|Festival of Ice}}
The Festival of Ice takes place on the 8th of every [[Winter]]. The player enters the festival by entering [[Cindersap Forest]] between 9am and 2pm. When the festival ends, the player is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.

At the festival there are ice sculptures and igloos set up as well as a small shop selling festive decorations. There's also an Ice Fishing Contest the player can take part in along with [[Pam]], [[Willy]], and [[Elliott]]. The player wins if they catch at least five fish. Players are automatically provided with a fishing rod for the duration of the competition. The first win earns the player two [[tackle]]s, 1 [[Magnet]] bait, and a [[Sailor's Cap]]. Subsequent years earn the player a [[Prize Ticket]].

The festival ends after Lewis announces the winner of the Ice Fishing contest.

===SquidFest===
[[File:SquidFest.png|thumb|right|SquidFest]]
{{Main article|SquidFest}}
The SquidFest takes place during Winter 12-13 on [[the Beach]]. It starts at 6:10am and ends at 2am. Players can catch [[Squid]] all day long. Each day, players can earn copper, iron, gold, and iridium tier prizes depending on how much Squid they caught. The counter for the amount of squids caught will reset on the beginning of the 13th. In addition, the prizes for each day are different.

To obtain all of the rewards, the player must catch 8 Squid on the 12th and 10 Squid on the 13th. Prizes include the [['Squid Kid']], the [[Squid Hat]], and [[The Art O' Crabbing]].

Shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the SquidFest, and time continues to pass during the festival.

===Night Market===
[[File:NightMarket.jpg|thumb|right|Night Market]]
{{Main article|Night Market}}
The Night Market takes place during Winter 15-17, on [[the Beach]], from 5pm-2am. The festival features shops, a mermaid show, and a deep-sea fishing submarine where the player can catch [[Fish#Night Market Fish|unique fish]].

Shops and homes throughout Stardew Valley are not closed on the days of the Night Market, and time continues to pass during the festival.

===Feast of the Winter Star===
[[File:Feast of the Winterstar Secret Santa.png|thumb|right|Feast of the Winter Star]]
{{Main article|Feast of the Winter Star}}
The Feast of the Winter Star takes place on the 25th of every [[Winter]]. The player attends the festival by entering [[Pelican Town]] between 9am and 2pm, and upon leaving the festival, is returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.

The main event of the Feast of the Winter Star is secret gift-giving. A random villager will be selected to give the player a gift, and they are assigned a random villager to give a gift to. A week beforehand, on the 18th, Mayor Lewis will send a letter telling the player who their gift recipient is. At the festival, talking to their gift recipient will pop up their inventory to decide gift to give. Upon giving a gift, the recipient will give a response and player's gift-receiving cutscene occurs, where they will find out who is giving them a gift at the festival.

The festival ends when the player leaves [[Pelican Town]].

==History==
