==Random Seed==
Hello AllUltima! You are doing a lot of work on the random seed mechanics of the game, and doing a good job documenting them, thank you! This is an interesting and valuable addition to the wiki.

Unfortunately, you are prematurely adding links to an unfinished page. Please ''finish'' the Random Seed page first, analyze the mechanics and be sure they are correct, and ''then (and only then)'' think about integrating the page into the rest of the wiki.

The fact that the page is undergoing constant revisions is enough of a reason to hold off on integrating it, but there is also the fact that changes in English have a cascading effect on 11 other language wikis. There is no way a translator can keep up with the changes you're making.

So, please keep analyzing the code and the game mechanics, but please stop adding "random seed" links to other pages! ok? The page is not ready yet!

Thanks very much, and good luck! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:29, 16 March 2023 (UTC)

==Deluxe Speed-Gro==
You don't seem big on communication, but I wanted to fully explain the reasons for my removing your edit to the [[Deluxe Speed-Gro]] page.

"Oak Resin is contested..." This doesn't make sense in English. I'm not sure what word you were going for, either, I'm afraid, but "contested" doesn't make sense.

A player can plant a mass of oak trees in another area (''e.g.,'' [[the Desert]]) although coral supply is limited. The section simply describes the cost of crafting it versus purchasing it. Making a profit by using speed-gro fertilizers is a separate topic. If you want to explore the profits for using different Speed-Gro fertilizers, then it would appropriate to make a page in your user space, and include all 3 types of fertilizers, and all crops, providing all supporting calculations on the page. If/when such a page is ready for the main wiki, it can be moved to the main namespace.

It might help you to read [[Help:Editing]], especially the part about discussing large-scale changes before implementing them. I hope this helps. Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:04, 20 March 2023 (UTC)

:Hi [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]]. I'm surprised to hear "I'm not sure what word you were going for, either, I'm afraid, but "contested" doesn't make sense."

:Is this a dialectic thing? I speak American English. I also see this in academic journal publications and I regularly use it in my technical writing. 
:See https://www.dictionary.com/browse/contested  ''involving more than one candidate:'' "Congressional redistricting and a '''contested''' Senate seat led to a series of competitive Michigan primaries on Tuesday."
:https://www.army.mil/article/254550/amcom_101_for_missiles_focuses_on_sustainment_implications_readiness_reporting  "There may be '''contested''' supply lines"
:More examples: Delays in processing can occur if the CPU is '''contested'''.
:etc. Try doing a google search for "contested resources" or "contested supply" for more similar examples of this usage. When a resource is "contested", it means it is needed for multiple purposes, stretched in multiple directions at once.
    
:Do you still think "Oak Resin is a contested resource if the player is expanding their supply of Kegs" is unreasonable? I was going for "precise" and "terse". I am pretty confident this is both grammatically correct and widely understood, but I guess maybe some people haven't heard this grammar before. It is a very widespread grammar on anything related to computer resources, which may be biasing my perspective on common English.

:A longer form would be "Keep in mind Oak Resin is an ingredient used for Kegs as well", but the latter feels less precise / wiki quality to me. If the player has ambitions to make lots of kegs (which they should), then wasting the Oak Resin is not a good idea, and a single sentence word of caution feels helpful to me. (I am aware that massive amounts of Oak Resin can eventually be achieved, but during Year 1 (when many people are finishing the game anyway), it is tough to justify not putting all of the Oak Resin into Kegs. In Fall of Year 1 I generally buy hundreds of Deluxe Speed Gro from Sandy as this is the fastest path to being able to purchase everything in year 1. There isn't enough time or Oak Seeds to expand the trees quickly enough (and I start expanding my oak trees on the first day))

:[[User:AllUltima|AllUltima]] ([[User talk:AllUltima|talk]]) 21:43, 20 March 2023 (UTC)

:(I'm aware there are multiple ways to play the game, but the article, as is, is actively misleading the reader to think that purchasing deluxe speed gro is a bad idea. And single sentence warning about the contested nature of the Oak Resin, is, IMO, a nice warning because early players (such as my wife) can forget this and craft Deluxe Speed Gro and then not be able to craft more kegs for quite a while)

:(Also, I'm not sure if you're even notified about this type of reply. I may be doing the reply wrong. I'll post on your talk page if you don't respond here)

:[[User:AllUltima|AllUltima]] ([[User talk:AllUltima|talk]]) 21:51, 20 March 2023 (UTC)

::Yes, AllUltima, I'm notified about all new edits on all 12 language wikis, which I check every day. All 14 edits to this page are marked as needing review. So, I don't mean to sound snarky in any way, but if you could make use of the "Show preview" button before saving an edit, my life would be easier.
::I've read the page again, and it simply states that "Crafting Deluxe Speed-Gro is always cheaper than purchasing it." This is a presentation of the facts, and the reader can make their own conclusions. There is no recommendation to craft it, simply a comparison of the cost, under the heading "Cost". It reads exactly the same as the [[Speed-Gro]] page, as it should. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:27, 20 March 2023 (UTC)

:::Hi [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]].

:::Technically correct, yes, but actively misleading. Upon seeing that, a reader is likely to think "I see, it's better to craft this." It's not. It's a gotcha for new players and simply incorrect for advanced players. Nobody is selling Coral+oak resin in the first place, so the passage may be objective, but its value is actually rather low and most people would probably be happier not reading that unless it is for trivia purposes.
:::In any case, pointing out that Oak Resin may be contested is also objectively true. But I can leave that part out. The rest of the analysis is also just objective cost analysis at this point.

:::I think part of my problem with the section is that an analysis of "Crafting Deluxe Speed-Gro is always cheaper than purchasing it" would normally be based on the '''purchase''' price of the crafting ingredients. Making such an analysis based off the selling price, and equating that with the value of the item is basically... "weasel words." Sell Price != Value. And "cheaper" doesn't really make sense in this context if you spend some time thinking about it. In a sense, both coral and oak resin are "priceless" in this game (If oak resin were for sale for 1000g each, I'd buy a hundred in a heartbeat). You can't buy them. I don't think you're really supposed to be selling Oak Resin, there is no strategy where that's a smart way to play (even a tapper would be selling maple...). There are lots of items like this. Void Essence is "trash" according to its selling price.

::::Your repeated reversions of edits made by an Admin is unwise. Placing a comment on the talk page was very wise. I have locked the page for editing, pending other input. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 03:12, 21 March 2023 (UTC)
