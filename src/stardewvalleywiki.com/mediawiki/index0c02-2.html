==Help, please!==
I don't really see what this means by "Can be purchased from [[Morris]]". Do I have to purchase all the upgrades first? Because I thought that unlocks [[Ginger Island]]. [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 18:46, 4 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva
:Talking to Morris after purchasing all upgrades unlocks an [[Joja_Warehouse#After_Form_Completion|exciting opportunity]].  You have to speak to Morris for him to offer the opportunity. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:53, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
Thanks! I didn't think to look at the Joja Warehouse page. [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 22:42, 4 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva

Ok [[User:Christopher|Christopher]] ([[User talk:Christopher|talk]]) 06:41, 1 December 2022 (UTC)

== can't buy cinema from joja ==

i completed 4 works from the culture house then bought joja membership package then when i came back to joja supermarket there was only construction bill but no offer to build a cinema [[User:Minhngoc1311.mn|Minhngoc1311.mn]] ([[User talk:Minhngoc1311.mn|talk]]) 08:20, 2 July 2021 (UTC)
:You can buy the cinema after: You completed all warehouse community upgrades (fully filled formular) and after you saw the "Finished Warehouse" cutscene.

:So just make sure you bought all upgrades on the formular from Morris and if you bought all, just sleep a day and enter the Town (eventually on a sunny day) from Bus stop to get the scene. If you already had the scene, go to Morris again and you should be able to buy the Movie Theater for {{price|500000}}. 
:Hope this helps you, [[User:Botautal|Someone called Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:52, 2 July 2021 (UTC)

== Using season templates for Movies table ==

I wouldn't be too opinionated about this change, but I don't really get the "''this really makes the table wider''" argument, since on my screen it makes literally zero difference; the column is ~115px wide on both version, the table ~1215px wide on full screen (for both versions) – tried on two browsers (Firefox, Chrome), and on mobile version (on mobile the text wraps a little bit on the Y1/2 for some season). Maybe I'm missing something?

For comparison: [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Movie_Theater&amp;oldid=126528#Movies no-icon version] – [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Movie_Theater&amp;oldid=129241#Movies with-icons version]

I think the season is a quite important info here and I'm a visual kind of person so I feel the icon addition is a plus.

-- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 00:23, 29 October 2021 (UTC)
:I've restored the season icons without using [[:Template:Season]], so the columns can wrap if they become too wide. I think this is even better than it was before the edits, thank you! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:54, 29 October 2021 (UTC)

:: Nice, thanks! I quite liked the fact it didn't wrap (it looked neat), but that's true it made the column wide if we resized the windows to smaller width. -- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 10:33, 30 October 2021 (UTC)


== Movie rotation ==

Either there is an error in the movie listings showing whether they're Year 1 or 2 or these statements are incorrect:

"Movies repeat on a 2-year cycle, based on the season in which the player unlocks the Movie Theater. All four "year 1" movies will cycle, followed by year 2 movies, then repeat."

I have in my game and a screenshot available [I don't know if it's ok to link an img here] of "Journey of the Prairie King" (listed here as Year 1) in summer with a poster showing "It Howls in the Rain" (listed here as Year 2) in Fall of the same year.  [[User:Pecupikl|Pecupikl]] ([[User talk:Pecupikl|talk]]) 16:42, 5 December 2021 (UTC)

-- Never mind it's probably just a partial year (maybe I originally opened the theater in fall, so that's when my new movie year starts).  I'll have to wait til winter to confirm, but I'm now guessing this is the reason. [[User:Pecupikl|Pecupikl]] ([[User talk:Pecupikl|talk]]) 16:50, 5 December 2021 (UTC)
== Movie snacks ==
The recent changes have made the page contradict itself. It says there will always be a loved snack, but also indicates that Leo doesn't have any loved snacks. I took Leo to the movies on one of my old saves and was offered Sour Slimes, Cotton Candy, Black Licorice, Jawbreaker, and Ice Cream Sandwich. All are liked except for Black Licorice (disliked), according to the Wiki. I can verify that he likes Sour Slimes at least. I don't have the tools to look at the code, but clearly something is amiss. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 00:13, 18 August 2022 (UTC)
:Based on what I gather from game data (&lt;samp>Data\ConcessionTastes.json&lt;/samp> and &lt;samp>MovieTheater::GetConcessionTasteForCharacter()&lt;/samp>), [[Leo]] ''should'' love Stardrop Sorbet, which has a reduced chance (namely 1/3) of being selected as the one mandatory loved snack in the list. I might add this to the page but I don't know who else can verify my findings (still hesitating). - [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 18:59, 18 August 2022 (UTC)
::I made the same mistake when I added movies &amp; concession tastes to all villagers' pages (in almost all 12 languages)! But in-game testing shows Leo only "likes" Stardrop Sorbet (I compared the save files to be sure). [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:22, 18 August 2022 (UTC)

== penny and pam? ==

in the movies page it says theres a small chance pam will attend a movie when you invite penny, and penny loves any movie if pam is there, but then in bugs it says pam never attends movies randomly when penny is invited?? is there just a chance this can happen to your save file, or is it really impossible for her to appear randomly when penny is invited? thank you in advance!! [[User:BaileyBee|BaileyBee]] ([[User talk:BaileyBee|talk]]) 17:38, 29 August 2023 (UTC)
:Hello BaileyBee! Unfortunately, it's not possible for Pam to randomly attend if Penny is an invited guest. There is game code indicating that ConcernedApe intended for Penny to love any movie if Pam randomly attends, but then ''someone'' (''i.e.,'' ConcernedApe) forgot to add a group of people that includes Pam and not Penny to the list of possible random groups of attendees.
:So, it can only happen in multiplayer, if one player invites Pam and another invites Penny and then both attend a movie at the same time. Sorry for the bad news. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:29, 29 August 2023 (UTC)

Thank you! thats so sad for pam!  [[User:BaileyBee|BaileyBee]] ([[User talk:BaileyBee|talk]]) 11:31, 30 August 2023 (UTC)
