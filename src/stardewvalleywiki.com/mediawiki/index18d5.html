{{Quote|Harvey is the town doctor. He’s a little old for a bachelor, but he has a kind heart and a respected position in the community. He lives in a small apartment above the medical clinic, but spends most of his time working. You can sense a sadness about him, as if there’s something he’s not telling you…|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Harvey''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in [[Pelican Town]]. He runs the town's [[Harvey's Clinic|medical clinic]] and is passionate about the health of the townsfolk. He's one of the twelve characters available to [[Marriage|marry]].

==Schedule==
On Tuesdays and Thursdays Harvey gives villagers their annual or quarterly checkups. On most other days he spends the morning manning the counter at the clinic, and the afternoon taking exercise around town. 

On rainy days, Harvey leaves the clinic and walks upstairs to his room at 12pm, regardless of whether or not there are patients in the clinic. Later, he stops by [[the Stardrop Saloon]].

After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Harvey may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Harvey will immediately go home to bed. Harvey never visits the Resort on Tuesdays, Thursdays, or [[Festivals|Festival]] days.

Shown below are Harvey's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others below it.

Harvey will dance with Maru at the [[Flower Dance]] if neither of them are dancing with the player.

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 2
 |trigger = Enter [[1 River Road|George's house]] while [[George]] is there.
 |details = Harvey is performing a private check-up on George. He tries to explain that George needs to make some lifestyle changes if he wants to keep healthy, but George seems irritated with his advice and states that he knows what's best for his own body. Harvey explains that he went to school for eight years so that he could help people in an attempt to get George to cooperate, but then his attention is drawn away as he notices your arrival. Harvey says you shouldn't be there because it is a private session, but George stops you from leaving by asking for a second opinion on the matter. 

* {{choice|"George should follow Dr. Harvey's advice."|40}} He again says that he's only trying to help and George finally gives in and agrees to follow doctor's orders. After that Harvey thanks you for the help and say that he appreciates you.
* {{choice|"George knows what's best for his own body."|-40}} He sighs and tells George that if he's going to behave like this, Harvey will have to tell George's wife and she won't be happy. George begrudgingly concedes to the doctor's orders. Harvey tells you that it's better not to give patients mixed messages.
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 4
 |trigger = Enter the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]] when Harvey is there.
 |details = Harvey says he was just about to write you a letter about how you're due for your annual check-up. As he's looking you over, he notices your pulse seems high.
* {{choice|"I'm a little nervous..."|20}} Harvey assumes that it's because of the Hospital and tells you to relax because he's here to help.
* {{choice|"I'm out of breath from working on the farm."|20}}
* {{choice|"Are you really a doctor? My pulse is fine!"|-50}}

At the end of it, Harvey declares you healthy and says you should take care not to overwork yourself on the farm.
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Enter the [[Pierre's General Store|general store]] between 11am and 3pm.
 |details = You witness a dance aerobics session with some of the ladies and, unexpectedly, Harvey. Harvey seems out of breath as the session comes to an end, heading towards the door to leave but running into you on the way. Harvey seems incredibly embarrassed when he finds out you were watching, wanting to keep it a secret. He explains that he's doing it to stay healthy, which becomes more difficult with age and the stress of running the clinic essentially alone. Harvey seems discouraged because of how difficult it is for him to keep up with the rest of the group, figuring he must not be in good shape. He asks you not to tell the rest of the town that he's doing dance aerobics. 
*{{choice|"I won't tell"|20}} Harvey thanks you and says that he appreciates you.
*{{choice|"I can't promise that."|-50}} Harvey sighs and says "rude".

[[File:Harvey Six Heart Event 1.jpg|400px]]
}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = Enter the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]].
 |details = You head into Harvey's room to find him using his equipment in an attempt to contact a pilot. He suddenly gets a response, surprising him and making his pulse race, but he manages to respond with his coordinates before quickly signing off. As you enter the room, you are presented with two choices:
* {{choice|"Ask Harvey why he's all flustered."}}
* {{choice|"Pretend like everything's normal."}}
Either way, Harvey's response is the same. He notices you and tells you he made contact with a real pilot. He excitedly tells you to come over to the window to watch the pilot fly overhead with him. After the plane passes Harvey opens up about how he always wanted to be a pilot when he was younger, but couldn't because of his bad eyesight and crippling fear of heights. He tells you not to be sad about it, that he's accepted not everyone can achieve their dreams and that is just the way the world is. Harvey tries to lighten the mood by asking you to look at his model planes, having just finished the TR-Starbird deluxe set.

[[File:Harvey Eight Heart Event.png|400px]]
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = Harvey sends you a letter asking to meet at the [[Railroad|railroad tracks]]. Go there between 9am and 5pm.
 |details = When you meet him there, he says he's glad you came and that something should be happening very soon. A man in a hot air balloon, Marcello, lands nearby, says the balloon is yours for the next two hours, and heads into town for [[the Stardrop Saloon]]. Harvey tells you that he saw the hot air balloon rental advertised in the newspaper and thought it was a perfect thing to do together. Before hopping in, you can either immediately get to it or ask him why he did this since you know about his incredible fear of heights. If you opt to ask him, he bashfully explains that while his fear is still a major factor, he admires you and your courage and says that it should be more than enough for the both of you. 

Boarding the hot air balloon, Harvey switches on the burner below to make it ascend but freaks out once he realizes how fast it's rising. High in the sky, his mood oscillates between fear and elation, eventually coming to his senses and remembering that you're there with him. He marvels at how much he can see below and is glad that he's doing this with you. Soon before the two-hour rental is up, you draw close into a kiss. You return the balloon to the rental man at least a half hour late.

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger = Enter an upgraded farm house (needs to be upgraded at least twice) between 8pm and midnight.
 |details = In the cutscene, Harvey is seen cooking and then setting the table for dinner. As you enter, Harvey says you're just in time and tells you he's cooked angel hair pasta with clams. He asks you how the dish tastes and he asks what you did that day. 

At the end, Harvey offers to wash the dishes and says he is happy to do so.

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Harvey will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to read. He will continue to work at the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]] and travel to [[Pelican Town|town]] to work there on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

On mornings when Harvey stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you [[Complete Breakfast]]. On rainy nights he may offer you dinner: [[Salmon Dinner]], [[Crispy Bass]], [[Fried Eel]], [[Carp Surprise]], or [[Vegetable Medley]].

==Timeline==
Harvey's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Harvey's style changed over the years before the game was launched.
[[File:Harvey Timeline.png|center]]

==Trivia==
[[File:Harvey Location Cutscene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Harvey's coordinates]]
* During the eight-heart event in his room, he mentions that his coordinates are 52 North, 43.5 East. In the real world, this would put his location in southwest Russia, between Ukraine and Kazakhstan. 
* When married to the player, he may admit a fondness for jazz music, as he listens to it when finalizing his medical reports.
* Despite telling others to eat healthily, his fridge is filled with convenience food and his microwave oven is well-used.
* Inside the [[Harvey's Clinic|clinic]], you can find several plaques on the wall. One states that the clinic is licensed by the Ferngill Republic Health Authority. Another is an advertisement for proper sneeze etiquette. A third in the back is an advertisement for a fictional drug Pravoloxinone which has the side-effect of "Complete disintegration of one or more bones" for 1 in 500 patients. Yet another near the back right of the clinic is described as a "The sign of the vessel", meant to comfort any patients believing in Yoba.
* Harvey's radio has a tape inside of it named "Anthology of Classic Jazz", and his TV is set to the history station. 
* In the left-most corner of Harvey's apartment, there's a poster stated to be a "comparison between fighter planes of the [[Setting#Nations|Ferngill Republic]] and the [[Gotoro Empire]]".
* In [[Secret Notes#Secret Note #7|Secret Note #7]], it is confirmed that he is one of three 'older bachelors' in Pelican Town.
* Despite loving [[Coffee]], he only likes the [[Triple Shot Espresso]].

==Bugs==
* If you exit Harvey's bedroom after raising his friendship to 8 hearts, his 8 heart cut scene will trigger, but the farmer will be facing the wrong way, causing the game to soft-lock. Skipping the cut scene will release the player.
* Trees planted to the left of the stairs in the Railroad area will prevent the ten heart event from progressing, forcing an event skip.

==History==
{{History|1.0|Introduced.}}
{{History|1.1|Added reading garden area behind farmhouse if [[Marriage|married]].}}
{{History|1.3.27|Added group 10-heart event.}}
{{History|1.4|Added 14 heart event. Now goes to the [[Museum]] on Saturdays. Now dislikes many [[Cooking#Recipes|cooked dishes]]. Fixed bug where viewing the 10-heart event while a train passed would soft-lock the game. Now goes to [[the Stardrop Saloon]] at night.}}
{{History|1.5|Added beach portraits.}}
{{History|1.6|Added winter portraits and more beach portraits. Added [[Harvey Portrait]].}}
