SMAPI provides several C# events which let your mod respond when something happens (like when the player places an object) or run code periodically (like once per update tick).

==FAQs==
===What are events?===
Events let you run code when something happens. You can add any number of ''event handlers'' (methods to call) when an ''event'' (what happened) is raised. You can think of events and handlers as a ''when..then'' statement:
&lt;pre>
WHEN the save is loaded,   &lt;-- event
THEN run my code           &lt;-- event handler
&lt;/pre>

See [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/events/ ''Events'' in the C# programming guide] for more info.

===How do I use them?===
Event handlers are usually added in your &lt;samp>Entry&lt;/samp> method, though you can add and remove them anytime. For example, let's say you want to print a message when each day starts. First you would choose the appropriate event from the list below (&lt;samp>[[#GameLoop.DayStarted|GameLoop.DayStarted]]&lt;/samp>), then add an event handler, and do something in your method code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
/// &lt;summary>The main entry point for the mod.&lt;/summary>
internal sealed class ModEntry : Mod
{
    /**********
    ** Public methods
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The mod entry point, called after the mod is first loaded.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="helper">Provides simplified APIs for writing mods.&lt;/param>
    public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
    {
        // event += method to call
        helper.Events.GameLoop.DayStarted += this.OnDayStarted;
    }

    /// &lt;summary>The method called after a new day starts.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="sender">The event sender.&lt;/param>
    /// &lt;param name="e">The event arguments.&lt;/param>
    private void OnDayStarted(object? sender, DayStartedEventArgs e)
    {
       this.Monitor.Log("A new day dawns!", LogLevel.Info);
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

Tip: you don't need to memorise the method arguments. In Visual Studio, type &lt;code>helper.Events.GameLoop.SaveLoaded +=&lt;/code> and press {{key|TAB}} to auto-create a method. (There doesn't seem to be an equivalent feature in MonoDevelop.)

&lt;samp>sender&lt;/samp> is part of the C# event pattern, and is unused by SMAPI.

===How do events fit into the game?===
Events are raised on each game tick (when the game updates its state and renders to the screen), which is 60 times per second. An event may be raised multiple times (''e.g.,'' if the player pressed two keys simultaneously), but most events won't be raised 60 times per second (''e.g.,'' players are unlikely to be pressing 60 buttons per second).

Your event handlers are run ''synchronously'': the game is paused and no other mod's code will run simultaneously, so there's no risk of conflicting changes. Since code runs very quickly, players won't notice any delay unless your code is unusually slow. That said, when using frequent events like &lt;samp>UpdateTicked&lt;/samp> or &lt;samp>Rendered&lt;/samp>, you should cache expensive operations (like loading an asset) instead of repeating them in each tick to avoid impacting performance.

===What if a mod changes what the event was raised for?===
Events are raised based on a snapshot of the game state. That's usually ''but not necessarily'' the current game state.

For example, consider this case:
# The &lt;samp>GameMenu&lt;/samp> opens.
# SMAPI raises the &lt;samp>MenuChanged&lt;/samp> event, which mods A and B listen to.
# Mod A receives the event and closes the menu.
# Mod B receives the event.

Each mod is still handling the &lt;samp>MenuChanged&lt;/samp> event for the opened menu, even though the first mod closed it. SMAPI will raise a new &lt;samp>MenuChanged&lt;/samp> event for the closed menu on the next tick.

This rarely affects mods, but it's something to keep in mind if you need the current state (''e.g.,'' check &lt;samp>Game1.activeClickableMenu&lt;/samp> instead of &lt;samp>e.NewMenu&lt;/samp>).

==Events==
The available events are documented below.

===Content===
&lt;samp>this.Helper.Events.Content&lt;/samp> has events related to assets loaded from the content pipeline.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! event
! summary
{{/event
 |group = Content
 |name  = AssetRequested
 |desc  = Raised when an asset is being requested from the content pipeline. The asset isn't necessarily being loaded yet (''e.g.'' the game may be checking if it exists).

You can register the changes you want to apply using the event arguments below; they'll be applied when the asset is actually loaded. See the [[Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Content|content API]] for more info.

If the asset is requested multiple times in the same tick (e.g. once to check if it exists and once to load it), SMAPI might only raise the event once and reuse the cached result.

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>IAssetName&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The name of the asset being requested, including the locale code if any (like the &lt;samp>.fr-FR&lt;/samp> in &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>). This includes utility methods to parse the value, like &lt;code>e.Name.IsEquivalentTo("Portraits/Abigail")&lt;/code> (which handles any differences in formatting for you).

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.NameWithoutLocale&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>IAssetName&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = Equivalent to &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp> but without the locale code (if any). For example, if &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp> is &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>, this field will contain &lt;samp>Data/Bundles&lt;/samp>.

 |arg name 3 = &lt;samp>e.LoadFrom(...)&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 3 = ''method''
 |arg desc 3 = Call this method to provide the initial instance for the asset, instead of trying to load it from the game's &lt;samp>Content&lt;/samp> folder. For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
e.LoadFrom(() => this.Helper.Content.Load&lt;Texture2D>("assets/portraits.png"), AssetLoadPriority.Medium);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

Usage notes:
* The asset doesn't need to exist in the game's &lt;samp>Content&lt;/samp> folder. If any mod loads the asset, the game will see it as an existing asset as if it was in that folder.
* Each asset can logically only have one initial instance. If multiple loads apply at the same time, SMAPI will raise an error and ignore all of them. If you're making changes to the existing asset instead of replacing it, you should use the &lt;samp>Edit&lt;/samp> method instead to avoid those limitations and improve mod compatibility.

 |arg name 4 = &lt;samp>e.LoadFromModFile&lt;T>(...)&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 4 = ''method''
 |arg desc 4 = Call this method to provide the initial instance for the asset by loading a file from your mod folder. For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
e.LoadFromModFile&lt;Texture2D>("assets/portraits.png", AssetLoadPriority.Medium);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

See usage notes on &lt;samp>e.LoadFrom&lt;/samp>.

 |arg name 5 = &lt;samp>e.Edit(...)&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 5 = ''method''
 |arg desc 5 = Call this method to apply edits to the asset after it's loaded. For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
e.Edit(asset =>
{
    Texture2D ribbon = this.Helper.Content.Load&lt;Texture2D>("assets/ribbon.png");
    asset.AsImage().PatchImage(source: overlay, patchMode: PatchMode.Overlay);
});
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

Usage notes:
* Editing an asset which doesn't exist has no effect. This is applied after the asset is loaded from the game's &lt;samp>Content&lt;/samp> folder, or from any mod's &lt;samp>LoadFrom&lt;/samp> or &lt;samp>LoadFromModFile&lt;/samp>.
* You can apply any number of edits to the asset. Each edit will be applied on top of the previous one (i.e. it'll see the merged asset from all previous edits as its input).

{{/event
 |group = Content
 |name  = AssetsInvalidated
 |desc  = Raised after one or more assets were [[Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Content#Cache invalidation|invalidated from the content cache]] by a mod, so they'll be reloaded next time they're requested. If the assets will be reloaded or propagated automatically, this event is raised before that happens.

Next time the asset is loaded (including for asset propagation), the [[#Content.AssetRequested|&lt;samp>AssetRequested&lt;/samp>]] event will be raised again.

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.Names&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>IReadOnlySet&lt;IAssetName>&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The asset names that were invalidated, including the locale code if any (like the &lt;samp>.fr-FR&lt;/samp> in &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>). These include utility methods to parse the values, like &lt;code>name.IsEquivalentTo("Portraits/Abigail")&lt;/code> (which handles any differences in formatting for you).

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.NamesWithoutLocale&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>IReadOnlySet&lt;IAssetName>&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = Equivalent to &lt;samp>e.Names&lt;/samp> but without the locale code (if any). For example, if &lt;samp>e.Names&lt;/samp> contains &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>, this field will contain &lt;samp>Data/Bundles&lt;/samp>.
}}
{{/event
 |group = Content
 |name  = AssetReady
 |desc  = Raised after an asset is loaded by the content pipeline, after any mod edits specified via [[#Content.AssetRequested|&lt;samp>AssetRequested&lt;/samp>]] have been applied.

This event is only raised if something requested the asset from the content pipeline. Invalidating an asset from the content cache won't necessarily reload it automatically.

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>IAssetName&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The name of the asset that was loaded, including the locale code if any (like the &lt;samp>.fr-FR&lt;/samp> in &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>). This includes utility methods to parse the value, like &lt;code>e.Name.IsEquivalentTo("Portraits/Abigail")&lt;/code> (which handles any differences in formatting for you).

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.NameWithoutLocale&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>IAssetName&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = Equivalent to &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp> but without the locale code (if any). For example, if &lt;samp>e.Name&lt;/samp> is &lt;samp>Data/Bundles.fr-FR&lt;/samp>, this field will contain &lt;samp>Data/Bundles&lt;/samp>.
}}
{{/event
 |group = Content
 |name  = LocaleChanged
 |desc  = Raised after the game language changes. For non-English players, this may be raised during startup when the game switches to the previously selected language.

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.OldLanguage&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>LanguageCode&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The previous value for the game's language enum. For a custom language, this is always &lt;samp>LanguageCode.mod&lt;/samp>.

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.OldLocale&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>string&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = The previous value for the locale code. This is the locale code as it appears in asset names, like &lt;samp>fr-FR&lt;/samp> in &lt;samp>Maps/springobjects.fr-FR&lt;/samp>. The locale code for English is an empty string.

 |arg name 3 = &lt;samp>e.NewLanguage&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 3 = &lt;samp>LanguageCode&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 3 = The new value for the game's language enum. See notes on &lt;samp>OldLanguage&lt;/samp>.

 |arg name 4 = &lt;samp>e.NewLocale&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 4 = &lt;samp>string&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 4 = The previous value for the locale code. See notes on &lt;samp>OldLocale&lt;/samp>.

===Display===
&lt;samp>this.Helper.Events.Display&lt;/samp> has events linked to UI and drawing to the screen.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! event
! summary
{{/event
 |group = Display
 |name  = MenuChanged
 |desc  = Raised after a game menu is opened, closed, or replaced.

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.OldMenu&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>IClickableMenu&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = The old menu instance (or &lt;samp>null&lt;/samp> if none).

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.NewMenu&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>IClickableMenu&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The new menu instance (or &lt;samp>null&lt;/samp> if none).
}}
{{/event
 |group = Display
 |name  = Rendering
 |desc  = Raised before the game draws anything to the screen in a draw tick, as soon as the sprite batch is opened.

===Game loop===
&lt;samp>this.Helper.Events.GameLoop&lt;/samp> has events linked to the game's update loop. The update loop runs roughly ≈60 times/second to run game logic like state changes, action handling, etc. These are often useful, but you should consider semantic events like &lt;samp>Input&lt;/samp> where applicable.

This happens immediately before the game approves the connection, so the player doesn't exist in the game yet.

{{/event
 |group = Specialised
 |name  = LoadStageChanged
 |desc  = Raised when the low-level stage in the game's loading process has changed, for mods which need to run code at specific points in the loading process. The available stages or when they happen might change without warning in future versions (''e.g.,'' due to changes in the game's load process), so '''mods using this event are more likely to break or have bugs'''. Most mods should use the [[#Game loop|game loop events]] instead.

 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.NewStage&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>LoadStage&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The new load stage. The possible values are...

* &lt;code>None&lt;/code>: a save is not loaded or loading. (For example, the player is on the title screen.)
* When creating a new save slot:
** &lt;code>CreatedBasicInfo&lt;/code>: the game has initialised the basic save info.
** &lt;code>CreatedInitialLocations&lt;/code>: the game has added the location instances, but hasn't fully initialized them yet.
** &lt;code>CreatedLocations&lt;/code>: the game has initialised the in-game locations.
** &lt;code>CreatedSaveFile&lt;/code>: the game has created the physical save files.
* When loading an existing save slot:
** &lt;code>SaveParsed&lt;/code>: the game has read the raw save data into &lt;samp>StardewValley.SaveGame.loaded&lt;/samp>. Not applicable when connecting to a multiplayer host. This is equivalent to &lt;samp>StardewValley.SaveGame.getLoadEnumerator&lt;/samp> value 20.
** &lt;code>SaveLoadedBasicInfo&lt;/code>: the game has applied the basic save info (including player data). Not applicable when connecting to a multiplayer host. Note that some basic info (like daily luck) is not initialised at this point. This is equivalent to &lt;samp>StardewValley.SaveGame.getLoadEnumerator&lt;/samp> value 36.
** &lt;code>SaveAddedLocations&lt;/code>: the game has added the location instances to the game, but hasn't restored their save data yet.
** &lt;code>SaveLoadedLocations&lt;/code>: the game has restored the in-game location data. Not applicable when connecting to a multiplayer host. This is equivalent to &lt;samp>StardewValley.SaveGame.getLoadEnumerator&lt;/samp> value 50.
* &lt;code>Preloaded&lt;/code>: the final metadata has been loaded from the save file. This happens before the game applies problem fixes, checks for achievements, starts music, etc. Not applicable when connecting to a multiplayer host.
* &lt;code>Loaded&lt;/code>: the save is fully loaded, but the world may not be fully initialised yet.
* &lt;code>Ready&lt;/code>: the save is fully loaded, the world has been initialised, and [[Modding:Modder Guide/APIs/Utilities#Context|&lt;samp>Context.IsWorldReady&lt;/samp>]] is now true.
* &lt;code>ReturningToTitle&lt;/code>: The game is exiting the loaded save and returning to the title screen. This happens before it returns to title; the stage ''after'' it returns to title is &lt;code>None&lt;/code>.

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.OldStage&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>LoadStage&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = The previous load stage. See comments for &lt;samp>e.NewStage&lt;/samp>.

{{/event
 |group = Specialised
 |name  = UnvalidatedUpdateTicking, UnvalidatedUpdateTicked
 |desc  = Raised before/after the game updates its state (≈60 times per second), regardless of normal SMAPI validation. This event is not thread-safe and may be invoked while game logic is running asynchronously. Changes to game state in this method may crash the game or corrupt an in-progress save. '''Do not use this event unless you're fully aware of the context in which your code will be run. Using this event will trigger a warning in the SMAPI console.'''


 |arg name 1 = &lt;samp>e.Ticks&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 1 = &lt;samp>int&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 1 = The number of ticks elapsed since the game started, including the current tick.

 |arg name 2 = &lt;samp>e.IsOneSecond&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 2 = &lt;samp>bool&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 2 = Whether &lt;samp>e.TicksElapsed&lt;/samp> is a multiple of 60, which happens approximately once per second.

 |arg name 3 = &lt;samp>e.IsMultipleOf(int number)&lt;/samp>
 |arg type 3 = ''method'' returns &lt;samp>bool&lt;/samp>
 |arg desc 3 = Whether &lt;samp>e.TicksElapsed&lt;/samp> is a multiple of the given number. This is mainly useful if you want to run logic intermittently (''e.g.,'' &lt;code>e.IsMultipleOf(30)&lt;/code> for every half-second).

==Advanced==
===Change monitoring===
You may want to handle a change that doesn't have its own event (''e.g.,'' an NPC's heart event ends, a letter is added to the mailbox, etc). You can usually do that by handling a general event like [[#GameLoop.UpdateTicked|&lt;samp>UpdateTicked&lt;/samp>]], and detecting when the value(s) you're watching changed. For example, here's a complete mod which logs a message when an in-game event ends:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
/// &lt;summary>The main entry point for the mod.&lt;/summary>
internal sealed class ModEntry : Mod
{
    /*********
    ** Fields
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The in-game event detected on the last update tick.&lt;/summary>
    private Event LastEvent;


    /*********
    ** Public methods
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The mod entry point, called after the mod is first loaded.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="helper">Provides simplified APIs for writing mods.&lt;/param>
    public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
    {
        helper.Events.GameLoop.UpdateTicked += this.OnUpdateTicked;
    }


    /*********
    ** Private methods
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The method invoked when the game updates its state.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="sender">The event sender.&lt;/param>
    /// &lt;param name="e">The event arguments.&lt;/param>
    private void OnUpdateTicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (this.LastEvent != null &amp;&amp; Game1.CurrentEvent == null)
            this.Monitor.Log($"Event {this.LastEvent.id} just ended!");

        this.LastEvent = Game1.CurrentEvent;
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

===Custom priority===
SMAPI calls event handlers in the same order they're registered by default, so the first event handler registered is the first to receive the event each time. This isn't always predictable, since it depends on mod load order and when each mod registers their handlers. This order is also an implementation detail, so it's not guaranteed.

If you need more control over the order, you can specify an event priority using the &lt;code>[EventPriority]&lt;/code> attribute: &lt;samp>Low&lt;/samp> (after most handlers), &lt;samp>Default&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>High&lt;/samp> (before most handlers), or a custom value (''e.g.,'' &lt;samp>High + 1&lt;/samp> is higher priority than &lt;samp>High&lt;/samp>). '''You should only do this if strictly needed'''; depending on event handler order between mods is fragile (''e.g.,'' the other mod might change its priority too).

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c#">
/// &lt;summary>The main entry point for the mod.&lt;/summary>
internal sealed class ModEntry : Mod
{
    /*********
    ** Public methods
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The mod entry point, called after the mod is first loaded.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="helper">Provides simplified APIs for writing mods.&lt;/param>
    public override void Entry(IModHelper helper)
    {
        helper.Events.GameLoop.UpdateTicked += this.OnUpdateTicked;
    }


    /*********
    ** Private methods
    *********/
    /// &lt;summary>The method invoked when the game updates its state.&lt;/summary>
    /// &lt;param name="sender">The event sender.&lt;/param>
    /// &lt;param name="e">The event arguments.&lt;/param>
    [EventPriority(EventPriority.High)]
    private void OnUpdateTicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this.Monitor.Log("Update!");
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>
