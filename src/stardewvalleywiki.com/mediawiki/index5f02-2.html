</p><p>In the spring schedual for Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, it says Penny goes to the ice cream stand with Jas and Vincent, but isn't the icecream stand only open in summer?
</p>
<dl><dd>The ice cream stand isn't open, but the structure is still there. The schedule says "Leaves the library and stands <i>near</i> the Ice Cream Stand watching over Jas and Vincent." <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:00, 27 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>observed 1.6 change:
In Summer on sundays Penny visits Maru instead of sitting next to the community center, maybe a pre-cc-completion schedule. <a href="../User_RealAlzario.html?title=User:RealAlzario&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RealAlzario (page does not exist)">RealAlzario</a> (<a href="../User_talk_RealAlzario.html?title=User_talk:RealAlzario&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:RealAlzario (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:13, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summer_Schedule">Summer Schedule</span></h2>
<p>Penny's Sunday schedule for Summer indicates that she goes to the Carpenter's Shop and spends the bulk of the afternoon there, and makes no mention of her sitting on the bench by the Community Center. This appears to be an error; on Summer 28 (a Sunday), I encountered her sitting on the bench by the Community Center, and from what I can tell, she <i>never</i> went to the Carpenter's Shop that day. This is also not covered by any of the options listed in her Deviations. <a href="../User_Sk00gle.html?title=User:Sk00gle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sk00gle (page does not exist)">Sk00gle</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Sk00gle.html?title=User_talk:Sk00gle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sk00gle (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:31, 1 August 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The schedule data files are notoriously complex. There is an entry for "summer" that has her in town most of the day, then later in the data file there is an entry for "Summer_Sun" meaning Sundays in Summer, where she goes to the Carpenter's shop from noon to 6pm.  I don't know which one takes precedence under what conditions. It's an ongoing problem for all villagers' schedules, unfortunately. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:42, 1 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Schedule_2">Schedule</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that in Penny's "Married" schedule, it says she teaches Vincent and Jas on Tuesday, Wednesday,and Friday, while elsewhere it is noted she doesn't tutor in Summer. I was looking for Penny on these days in summer, while married to her, and could not find her anywhere as the wiki does not say what she does on days (while married) that she doesn't tutor Vincent and Jas.

<dl><dd>As best as I can read her schedule file, she tutors the kids while married in Summer. There is a possibility that she follows the tutoring schedule without Vincent &amp; Jas being present. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:37, 18 July 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I'm really sorry, I don't have a save file that I can test! I honestly don't know where she might be... The schedule code is complex, so just looking at the schedule data file often isn't enough. I'll try to create a save where I marry Penny and see what happens.</dd>
<dd>You could also try posting in the official forums (link in left sidebar) for more visibility. There may be a bunch of people married to Penny that can test this. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:19, 18 July 2022 (UTC)

<p>Wouldn't Maru also be one of Penny's friends? They are often found sitting together on a bench. Are there specific criteria for what constitutes a friend on the Wiki? <a href="../User_Bigfarma.html" title="User:Bigfarma">Bigfarma</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Bigfarma.html?title=User_talk:Bigfarma&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Bigfarma (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:18, 5 November 2022 (UTC)
</p><p>Maru's page lists Penny as a friend, btw.

<dl><dd>Yep, it's explained on <a href="../Template_Infobox_villager.html" title="Template:Infobox villager">Template:Infobox villager</a>, the "friends" field should be limited to people who will give gifting hints about the villager. It also includes romantic interests, both of which are listed in the data file <samp>NPCDispositions.xnb</samp>.</dd>
<dd>If it helps, it's a source of confusion (and sometimes heated debate) on the wiki, and I'm working out a way to make the purpose of the field more clear. Perhaps I should eliminate it altogether, and leave friendships to the "Relationships" section of the page. In any case, I'll remove her from Maru's page for consistency in the meantime.

<p>So, there's no need to put File:Penny location 0.jpg and File:Penny location 1.jpg in <a href="../Penny.html#Schedule" title="Penny">her Schedule</a> either, right?
</p><p>I have to say that, the misinformation (especially with a picture!) about the day9&amp;23 schedules made me really confused for a long time. It's also quite weird that Penny's schedule is the only schedule that has pictures 😂.--<a href="../User_Shirotsuki.html" title="User:Shirotsuki">Shirotsuki</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Shirotsuki.html?title=User_talk:Shirotsuki&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Shirotsuki (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:49, 14 June 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Yes, the images can be removed from all languages! I removed several images from Abigail's schedule some years ago (probably when there were only 6 language wikis), but the task of removing images from Penny's pages has been pushed towards the bottom of my "to do" list, unfortunately. The fact that Penny has images and no one else does is because in the early days of the wiki, someone probably thought they would add images to all villagers' pages, and then... ran out of energy. It happens a lot (this is why I encourage people to discuss large projects before starting them!)
