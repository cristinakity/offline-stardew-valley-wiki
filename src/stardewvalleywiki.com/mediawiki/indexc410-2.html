<p>I'm not sure if this should go here. If there is time, it would be nice if mouseover functionality was added. This could be done with css or javascript, of which I have little experience with either, and am not sure if I'm even allowed to. I'm unsure if it could be one in other ways. This could be useful in places like when a Food is listed on a non-<a href="../Cooking.html" title="Cooking">Cooking</a> or item page, where source would say "Cooking" and hovering over the Cooking would give the ingredients required to make it. Currently when Food and non-food are in a table together, we have to add an extra column specifically for ingredients, making the ingredients be a hover over thing makes more sense to me. Same could be said for Crafting. If it can be done, maybe in <a href="../MediaWiki_Vector.html" title="MediaWiki:Vector.css">Mediawiki:Vector.css</a> or something similar, it could be translated onto a template and made simple enough for everyday editors to use. I have no idea how much I'm asking but it'd be appreciated if it could be done. -- <a href="../User_Kapra.html?title=User:Kapra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kapra (page does not exist)">Kapra</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Kapra.html?title=User_talk:Kapra&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Kapra (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:42, 25 March 2016 (EDT)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>It looks like the issue was the css for "locationimg" which auto-sizes to 90% of the infobox width. That works for the format of other building images, but the silo scales strangely.  I went ahead and just removed that id declaration from your template, it will display sizes at whatever the original image size is. I also added width as an optional parameter, so if you want to define a display width you can do it right in the template. Take a look at the change I made to your userpage.

<dl><dd>That's a feature of the underlying Mediawiki software (I was involved in the original development of Mediawiki, which is my "nerd badge" I guess). Mediawiki was specifically designed for Wikipedia, and was created when the original software stopped coping with the 200,000 pages Wikipedia had at the time (2003).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>One specific aspect of the design is that if the search finds a page with your search term (<a href="../Well.html" title="Well">Well</a>) it immediately stops searching for the word anywhere else. (If you then go to that page and then click "What Links Here" you will find all the pages which link to "well"). This was designed to prevent the search engine trying to search through the entire Wikipedia database (which would slow down the entire system). However, on a small wiki like this the search would not be hard at all. I think there is an option in the sysdamin control panel to disable this behaviour, but we'd need the Chucklefish wiki admin to handle that. <a href="../User_Manning.html?title=User:Manning&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Manning (page does not exist)">Manning</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Manning.html?title=User_talk:Manning&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Manning (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:43, 6 May 2016 (EDT)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>That's true. Wikipedia has a lot of articles about math and that's why the template is that complex. However, I think it would be useful to implement at least a part of the template to be able to display formulas that are more pleasing to the eye. Another option would be to be able to implement LaTeX code, since for example, with a simple "\dfrac {} {}" you get a pretty fraction. <a href="../User_Santiago.html?title=User:Santiago&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Santiago (page does not exist)">Santiago</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Santiago.html?title=User_talk:Santiago&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Santiago (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 07:12, 10 May 2017 (BST)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>After the Luau on the first year is completed, if you go to The Community Center around 10:30 PM-11:30 PM (I went because I was intending to put some items that day), you can see Demetrius going to the fountain. If you activate the dialogue with him, he is going to give the same answer that he gave at the Luau (the one that he tells Robin he is tired and wants to go to the buffet).
</p><p>Please consider on putting this as a kind of trivia since it does not appear neither at the Luau´s nor Demetrius´s webpage (even Demetrius´s schedule does not show that he goes to the fountain at that time).

<p>So pre-beta there were 59 fish to catch.  Beta added three new fish, the Midnight Squid, Spook Fish, and Blobfish.  The Master Angler achievement reads "Catch every fish", but I was just awarded it on the beta after having caught 59 fish, and not the 59 originals:  I caught all 3 of the new ones, but I am still missing Legend, Mutant Carp, and Dorado, yet I just received the Achievement.
</p><p>Seems like the tracking on the Achievement counts the number of distinct types of fish a player's caught, and when that number hits 59, they're awarded the achievement, regardless of the fact that there are now 62 fish to be caught, rather than checking every fish type to see if a player has successfully caught one of those types.

<dl><dd>Hi LadyElvina!  I'm sorry that happened to you!  The Golden Pumpkin will be a universally loved gift when you update your game to v1.3.  There aren't any other changes to gifting, so you should be good now that you know.</dd>

You might also find the <a href="../List_of_All_Gifts.html" title="List of All Gifts">List of All Gifts</a> handy.</dd>
<dd>We're in a weird transition period, where we're trying to display information for two versions of the game at the same time.

<p>Hi Admins,
</p><p>I've received the "Mass edit by new user" restriction that is preventing me from adding a new page. The page I'm adding is related to the unused bus scene (a screenshot of which is currently found in the <a href="../Bus_Stop.html" title="Bus Stop">Bus Stop</a> page). I decided that there was enough information on the topic that it was worth creating its own page instead of just adding it all to the Bus Stop page. Unfortunately, I do not have the privileges to do that at this time. The page I was trying to create was going to be named "Bus Ride (Deleted Scene)". Any chance I could get help adding this page?

</p>
<dl><dd>I think the contents of the deleted scene would fit better in a collapsable section on the Bus Stop page.  If you add it, please be sure to clean up the text by removing formatting marks like "$u" and "$s#$b#".  Also, it's important to add the name of the data file where you found the text.</dd>
<dd>The "mass edit" restriction is not time-based, but based on the number of edits you've made, so you will most likely have to add the information to the page in smaller increments.  Just save in-between edits, and you'll be able to add it all.  Good luck!  <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 16:49, 10 June 2019 (BST)</dd></dl>

Editing the part of Dialogue after the marriage, that is, the Dialogue of night time (Rainy, Indoor)_Night_ (here number) is a little small to represent the spouse. I thought there was a lack of conversation patterns at night. I wonder if there is any way to increase this. I've done a lot of work, and I know a lot of Dialogue's token and command. When I looking at the other mode and I wrote down the command and played it. but it didn't work. If there is a way I don't know, or if there is a problem that is completely impossible, please answer it.
</p><p>P.S. -- I somehow figured out how to use CP mode to increase the number of seasonal Night Dialogues a little bit.

<p>Hey guys,
</p><p>I was wondering if there is a kind of style guide for adding/editing articles on this wiki. Right now, for example, I'd like to know if in-game typos are taken over with a corresponding note (as seen on <a href="../Polka_Bow.html" title="Polka Bow">Polka Bow</a>) or if they are corrected (as seen on the german page <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://de.stardewvalleywiki.com/Kokosnuss">Kokosnuss</a>). Both examples refer to the in-game description of the respective item as you can see them in the info box.
</p><p>In general, I would appreciate an editing style guide that answers questions like this and also clarifies common sense rules like "be polite", "do not spam" etc. Ideally, it would be linked from the main page or shown as soon as you edit something such that it's easy enough to find. So far, I've tried searching for keywords like "style", "guide" or "rules", as well as skimming through this page, the <a href="../Special_SpecialPages.html" title="Special:SpecialPages">Special pages</a> and <a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">Margotbean's talk page</a> but found nothing.

<dl><dd>As far as in-game typos, they should appear on the wiki as-is, with a note explaining that the typo appears in-game.  There is a kind of style guide, linked to from the main page where it says "anyone can edit" -- the page is <a href="../Help_Editing.html" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>.  It appears to be a bit out of date, since I don't think the Visual Editor was ever implemented, but the paragraphs about keeping it concise and objective are still relevant.  Perhaps the Admin has some ideas about your suggestion.  You can also ask me or <a href="../User_Katzeus.html?title=User:Katzeus&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Katzeus (page does not exist)">Katzeus</a> any specific questions for now.  :)  <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 23:23, 12 December 2019 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi Marv!  I was able to see your edit in the abuse log.  There are a few problems with it, although I commend your effort at analysis!
<ol><li>It's missing a code reference (this needs to be based on v1.4 code, not v1.3)</li>
<li>The point of the tables isn't spelled out clearly.  What are they showing?  The odds of rolling each winning combo?</li>
<li>The point of having 2 tables was lost on me, I'm afraid.  Table 1 shows values based on neutral luck, and table 2 shows values that vary by different luck levels?  This confused me.</li></ol></dd>

<dl><dd>Hi Margotbean, thanks for your quick response.
<ol><li>Could you point me towards the format of making a code reference? I'm having a hard time finding an example</li>
<li>I'd add a key to the first table, explaining each column.</li>
<li>For the second table, one could add an explanation also. It shows the influence of daily luck and luck buffs on the average payout (now explained in the key of the first table). It's hard to integrate everything into one table because of the three-dimensionality of the data (outcome, daily luck, luck buff.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>I'd be happy to take a suggestion regarding the tables, and even if the second one isn't too much data for a simple article. I just wanted to include as much detail as possible.</dd>
<dd>One could even add a table with the intermediate data of just the influence daily luck and luck buff on the luck modifier, but I thought the end result might be more interesting. Though, wanting to know the probability of a specific outcome at a specific luck value might also be interesting.</dd>
<dd>I think, ideally, you'd have just the first table that you could influence with a form and a script updating the values as you type in the luck modifiers, but I'm not sure if that would be possible in Wikimedia. I'm sure I've seen it somewhere, but it might require an add-on. <a href="../User_Marv.html?title=User:Marv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Marv (page does not exist)">Marv</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Marv.html?title=User_talk:Marv&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Marv (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 11:01, 24 December 2019 (UTC)

<p>Anyone can show a list of changes to an article or talk page going back to the start: choose a list size, time interval, and proceed earlier or later at will. Not so with "recent changes". Yes, I understand "recent". But I've returned after a necessary absence of 3 weeks and can't get back very far in what must be a long list. In fact, in the past, I have been unable to see all the changes that occurred in the prior 12-18 hours or so, even showing the complete 500 changes allowed. So "recent" may require some interpretation, but the limit of 500 is absolute and, I would argue, too small. Is there some reason we cannot look further back? I find it hard to believe that there is no need at all (I have needed to), and I also find it hard to believe that there are so many occasions to want to look far back that it would introduce lookup problems or inefficiencies for the Wiki.

</p><p>I'm not sure what the point is of requiring people to sign up to contribute if you're still going to block them from contributing something as small as updating a single section of a single page. I get wanting to block "mass edits," but it seems like that should kick in after someone is making <i>substantial</i> changes to <i>many</i> pages; not expanding three tables in a single section of a single page. It also seems that I am not the only person to encounter this error.

<p>I am in Winter, Year 1, on a new playthrough. I accepted a quest from Leah off the Bulletin Board to catch a red snapper for her. But the red snapper isn't available in Winter unless you have a Rain Totem, which is impossible to get in Year 1. It requires resources not readily available, such as truffle oil, which requires either getting a pig, or hoping the Merchant has a truffle that can be made into oil. Please consider removing this quest from appearing in Year 1. It might not be an issue further along in the game, but in the beginning, it's irritating trying to complete something that cannot be easily completed.

The reasons are as follows:
</p><p>First, Simplified Chinese is the most widely used Chinese variant in the world, with the largest number of native speakers. However, the vast majority of users of Simplified Chinese reside in China.
</p><p>Secondly, cloudflare's bot detection interception has caused a dramatic decline in the number of web visits to the official Stardew Valley Chinese Wiki, and has had a permanent impact. This led to the official Chinese Wiki being overtaken by a branch of huiji wiki in multiple search engine rankings.
</p><p>Thirdly, the unfriendly access environment for Simplified Chinese users caused by the first two has backfired on the official Wiki, resulting in the Chinese branch lacking updated content for a long time, with a large number of words aging badly and new words not being synchronized in time. On the other hand, this has exacerbated the fact that a large number of Chinese users prefer Huiji Wiki as the indexing target, and the official Chinese Wiki has lost a considerable number of potential users.

<p>Since Stardew Valley's new update, I was wondering if there was a discord to easily communicate between editors? If not than I think it would help majorly with conveying information, for example, why isn't the summit page finished? Has nobody gotten to the summit yet? And any other questions, a discord would help astronomically. I have experience in making discords and I could probably set one up (with relieving myself of the owner position of course, after I finished) Just asking because I've looked for a discord but could not find one, just feels like there is a lack of communication.

Otherwise I can continue adding the "License CA" template after upload.
