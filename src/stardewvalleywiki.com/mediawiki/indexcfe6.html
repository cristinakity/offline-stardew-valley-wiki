==Dialogue==
I have found a few new dialogue and i dont know which ones I should put them under. I forgot when he said them except for 2

1:I wonder what everyone in town is doing today?

At 11:20 AM

2: If you go into town, make sure and say hi to everyone for me.

3: Do you think your grandpa would be proud of the work we've done?

4: I'll do the laundry tomorrow morning before you get up... that way you won't have any down-time. 

5- I don't really feel like doing anything today.

At 4:50 PM.

I don't know where these would go, so I am only asking the community. 

Currently I am married to Elliott and these dialogues came around at 6-8 years of marriage (I am on year 9 right now.) I am also at 14 hearts with him.
--[[User:Alexsdv|Alexsdv]] ([[User talk:Alexsdv|talk]]) 12:41, 17 March 2021 (UTC)
:All the quotes listed can be found in the data file &lt;samp>MarriageDialogue.xnb&lt;/samp>, so any spouse can say them.  They are all listed as "Neutral" quotes, meaning Elliott was feeling neither particularly good nor bad when he said them.  As for the times, I simply don't know what the time period is for a spouse to say any particular quote from that file.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:13, 17 March 2021 (UTC)

::I think I've seen the fifth and fourth one, I'm not sure what time but I'll try to find it. I'm on 14 hearts, but I'm not even even a year into marriage, so maybe I just thought I saw it? I'll try and look out for the times if I do see them, though!  [[User:Waterlemon|Waterlemon]] ([[User talk:Waterlemon|talk]]) 19:09, 18 April 2021 (UTC)

::update: he said the 4th one at 6:10, its also a Tuesday  and it's raining but I'm not sure if that interferes with it. [[User:Waterlemon|Waterlemon]] ([[User talk:Waterlemon|talk]]) 19:02, 19 April 2021 (UTC)

:::Adjustment: After marriage dialogue, Elliott uses different terms of endearment for telling you he's filed the adoption papers. I have a screenshot of him saying 'hunky' in place of 'hun' in this quote, and he has also used 'Love'. Because of this I think it's more fitting to write it like so:

:::1: [Term of endearment], I filed our adoption papers. Now all we can do is cross our fingers and wait.
:::[[User:Arachnerd|Arachnerd]] ([[User talk:Arachnerd|talk]]) 16:47, 17 May 2023 (UTC)
::::Correct you are! There are 15 different terms of endearment that ''any'' spouse may use in that sentence, depending on their mood. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:54, 17 May 2023 (UTC)

==Torch==
I encountered a new piece of dialogue and would put it in the page if I wasn't so unsure of the circumstances in which Elliott says it.

"Don't put a torch near my hair!"

I would simply put it in the page if I didn't happen to have a torch in my inventory at the time of the dialogue, which I did. I am unsure as to whether or not having a torch in your inventory is what triggers it but I think it's pretty likely. [[User:Cononsberg|Cononsberg]] ([[User talk:Cononsberg|talk]]) 03:41, 1 May 2021 (UTC)

==Schedule==
I was on Year 2 Fall Fri. 5 (Elliott's birthday) and I noticed Elliott standing on the bridge by the entrance to the ocean. He left for home at 6pm (similar to his Spring Tuesday and Spring Regular schedule), but this occurrence of him on the bridge seems to go against Elliott's recorded Fall Friday activities (regardless of the player's friendship with Leah; I did have six hearts with Leah for the record, though). Would someone be able to corroborate this or refute it? Is this possibly a birthday-specific schedule? 
[[User:WhiteChili01|WhiteChili01]] ([[User talk:WhiteChili01|talk]]) 08:49, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
:There's nothing in Elliott's schedule file to account for this behavior, he should have gone to Pierre's General Store. I wonder if Pierre was at the Beach Resort that day, and that accounts for the change? Otherwise, I truly don't know. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:02, 22 December 2021 (UTC)

I just encountered this same thing! I went looking for Elliot to give him a birthday gift, and checked Pierre’s first. Pierre was at the store (and still is now, at 4:30 in game), not at ginger island. I then found Elliot in his cabin around 2pm. I hadn’t seen his 2 or 8 heart cut scenes yet, and had both when entering his house, not sure if that would have any effect? He then left his house following the cutscenes, right after 3pm. He’s now standing on the bridge, seeming to follow his spring regular schedule. I have 6+ hearts with Leah as well. 

[[User:Wormbin|Wormbin]] ([[User talk:Wormbin|talk]]) 22:32, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

==Access==
Like Leah, there is a two heart requirement to enter his house in all seasons except for Winter.  I will look to add this to the page later. [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 21:59, 29 June 2022 (UTC)
:Margotbean, did you test entering Elliott's and Leah's houses in Winter? [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 18:48, 21 September 2022 (UTC)
::Yep, I sure did. Steam v1.5 Hotfix #3. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:58, 21 September 2022 (UTC)
:::What time of day? It needs to be either in the normal open hours, or you have key to the town.  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tqrnqsgUllmpoiNddt7HMMNsyhOPyUoa/view?usp=sharing [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 19:14, 21 September 2022 (UTC)
::::Ah, yes, it was after 6pm. Let's put the info back, but be a bit more explicit about the details. I myself checked the code when you added the change originally, but since then, misread what was on the wiki, thinking all restrictions didn't apply in Winter. (Btw, the key to the town doesn't normally open Leah's Cabin or Elliott's Cottage.) If you'd like to do so, feel free; otherwise, I will put the info back late tonight or tomorrow. ok? Thanks very much! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:33, 21 September 2022 (UTC)
:::::Leah's Cabin, Elliot's Cottage, and Maru's outside door have two requirements to open, time and friendship. Key to the town removes the time requirement, Winter removes the friendship requirement. [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 21:46, 21 September 2022 (UTC)

== Dialogue during Desert Festival (married) ==

I catched his dialogue during the Desert Festival (he was there on Monday) and we're married. I'm not really experienced in editing the wiki, but if someone could add this for me I would be glad!

"Well well well, what have we here? A beautiful desert rose! Make sure to stay watered, dear." [[User:Flowereyedgirl|Flowereyedgirl]] ([[User talk:Flowereyedgirl|talk]]) 23:05, 5 April 2024 (UTC)

== Seeing 8-Heart event before 2-Heart event ==

so Elliot invited me to his book signing despite me never getting around to triggering the heart events in his house - his book was sci-fi, and he still dedicated it to me and said I picked the genre. (I would have picked sci-fi anyway, but still.)
Anyone know if that gets randomized or what? [[User:Rangerbookwyrm|Rangerbookwyrm]] ([[User talk:Rangerbookwyrm|talk]]) 22:49, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

== Neutrals ==

I've found out that Elliot actually isn't neutral towards sea urchins and actually hates them, he uses the hate dialogue when given them instead of the neutral one. It messed up my hearts with him because i gave him one expecting the neutral reaction except he then reacted like he hated it.

I don't know if something in the listing changed or what, but it kinda ticked me off-

:The wiki can add a giant spoiler box and a history section, but the wiki cannot make anyone read them. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 11:53, 21 June 2024 (UTC)
