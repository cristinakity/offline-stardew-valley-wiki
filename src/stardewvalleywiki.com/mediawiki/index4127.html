For example, a base axe which breaks the giant crop in three hits gets three 20% chances of dropping 2 crops.&lt;/small>
:* The [[The Cave|mushroom cave]] now provides mushrooms every second day. It was unintentionally changed to daily in Stardew Valley 1.5.
:* You can no longer plant trees in the beach farm tunnel.
:* Randomization no longer produces simple repeating patterns in many cases (e.g. clay farming, mushroom level prediction, crab pot fish offset, etc).&lt;br />&lt;small>(You can enable "Use Legacy Randomization" in the advanced save options to use the old randomization, though some specific patterns may still change due to the underlying changes. That option is mainly intended for speedrunners; most players should keep it disabled for the intended experience.)&lt;/small>
