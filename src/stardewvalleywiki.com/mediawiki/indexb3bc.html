'''Shane''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] in [[Pelican Town]] who is often rude and unhappy, is a heavy drinker, and suffers from depression. However, his attitude starts to change toward any player who chooses to befriend him. He works at [[JojaMart]] most days between 9am and 5pm unless the [[Community Center]] is completed, and he frequently spends his evenings in [[The Stardrop Saloon]]. He doesn't work on the weekend except on rainy days, and is frequently around Marnie's ranch.

In the Social Status menu, Shane's outfit will change to a Joja Corporation uniform when he is at his job at [[JojaMart]]. He's one of the twelve characters available to [[marriage|marry]].

==Schedule==
If it is raining, Shane will go to work at [[JojaMart]] on Saturdays or Sundays, if the [[Community Center]] is not complete. He will also go to work at JojaMart until the day after completing the Community Center.  Otherwise, he is usually found at [[The Stardrop Saloon]] in the evenings.

After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Shane may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Shane will immediately go home to bed. Shane never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days.

Shown below are Shane's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

}}

===Four Hearts===
After reaching four hearts with Shane, his dialogues with you will become more friendly.
{{heart event
 |hearts = 4
 |trigger = Enter [[Marnie's Ranch]] at any time.
 |details = Shane is found passed out in his room, surrounded by empty beer cans. Marnie asks you to do something, so you use your watering can on his head to wake him up. Marnie remarks that all he does is mope around and drink beer. When Marnie asks him what his plans for the future are, Shane says that he hopes he "won't be around long enough to need a plan." Jas overhears and runs away crying; Marnie follows her while Shane falls to the ground and cries while apologizing.

[[File:Shane 4 Hearts.png|250px]]
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
|hearts = 6
|trigger = Enter [[Cindersap Forest]] between 9am and 8pm while storming or raining.
|details = Shane is laying face down at the edge of the cliffs, again surrounded by empty beer cans. He tells you that he's miserable and asks you why he shouldn't just roll off the cliff. You can respond in four different ways:

* {{choice|"Because there's so much to live for!"|0}} "Maybe for you, but not for me! You're not going to understand... Just... go away. ...Ugh..."
* {{choice|"Jas needs you. You're like a father to her."|0}} "...You're right. Jas... Ugh, God... I'm a horrible, *hic*... selfish person. Now I feel even worse..."
* {{choice|"It would be a sin."|0}} "Yoba...? (Player), don't you know I'm an atheist? Ugh..."
* {{choice|"The decision is your own. Just know that I'm here for you."|0}} "Thanks... I appreciate that... I really do."

[[File:Shane 6 Hearts 1.png|400px]] [[File:Shane 6 Hearts 2.png|400px]]

After that Shane suggests that you should take him to the hospital, in the next cutscene Harvey treats his physical ailments but is more concerned about Shane's mental health. He tells you that he's going to recommend Shane to a counselor in [[Setting#Zuzu City|Zuzu City]] once he wakes up.

The next day, Shane will arrive at your farm to tell you that he intends to go to counselling. He also apologizes for the incident at the cliffs, to which you can respond in three different ways:

* {{choice|"I'm glad I was there to help."|10}} "...Yeah, me too."
* {{choice|"You needed a serious wake-up call."|-10}} "I know... That's why I stopped by, to tell you about it."
* {{choice|"I'm just happy you're still here."|10}} "Wow, it was that serious, huh? I can hardly remember..."
}}

===Seven Hearts I===
{{heart event
|hearts = 7
|trigger = Enter [[Marnie's Ranch]] while Shane is home after triggering Shane's six heart event.
|details = Shane enters the ranch, where Marnie is standing behind the counter. He tells her that he's been feeling happier than usual. Jokingly, she asks if there was a sale on beer. Though slightly annoyed, he responds by saying he's started drinking sparkling water instead. He then says that he's realized that he has people that he can rely on and that doing so doesn't make him weak. He walks over to Jas, who is in the kitchen, and gives her a present. She opens it to find a pair of expensive shoes that she had wanted. When she asks Shane how he could afford it, he replies that it's because he cut back on his expensive habit of drinking beer.
}}

===Seven Hearts II===
{{heart event
|hearts = 7
|trigger = Enter the town between 10am and 4pm on a sunny day. (Also requires 2 hearts with both [[Emily]] and [[Clint]].)
|details = You will find Shane filming a scene starring [[Emily]] and [[Clint]]. Shane will explain to you that Joja is holding a contest to create an advertisement for the newest Joja Cola, and the winner gets {{price|10000}}. He will ask you to walk behind Clint and Emily as they act so the scene feels more natural. When it's over, he will thank you for helping him.
''&lt;nowiki>*&lt;/nowiki> This event was Shane's six heart event before {{version|1.1|update 1.1}}.''
}}

===Seven Hearts III===
{{Hearts|7}}

After reaching 7 hearts with Shane, he will send you a recipe in the mail.

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
|hearts = 8
|trigger = Enter [[Marnie's Ranch]] while Shane is home.
&lt;br />Note: Will not trigger until the player has seen the follow-up visit from Shane after his 6-heart event.
|details = When you enter the ranch, Jas leads you through the door in the kitchen that is normally locked. Inside, Shane is painting a sign that says "Fresh Eggs." He's surrounded by his flock of special blue chickens and his favorite white chicken, Charlie. Once he finishes painting the sign, he picks up Charlie and briefly talks to her about his ambitions and his struggles. When you and Jas enter the room, Shane talks to you a bit about how he is trying to pass on the chicken knowledge to Jas so she can continue the tradition if he ever moves out.

[[File:Shane 8 Hearts.png|450px]]

After seeing this event, each chicken that the player purchases from [[Marnie]] and each egg that hatches in the incubator now has a 25% chance of being blue. Aside from appearance, the blue chickens are identical to white chickens.
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
|hearts = 10
|trigger = Exit your house before 6:30am to initiate the event, then walk to the [[Bus Stop]] between 4pm and 6pm.
|details = Shane invites you to go see the Zuzu City Tunnelers (a gridball team) play in their stadium in [[Setting#Zuzu City|Zuzu City]]. You take a bus into the city together and the scene changes to a grimy stadium with you and Shane in the stands. While cheering on the Tunnelers, Shane thanks you for sticking with him through his struggle with depression and anxiety. He then asks you what you think of your first gridball game:

* {{choice|"Noisy... It makes me appreciate how peaceful it is back home."|0}} "Oh yeah? I guess that makes sense. Me? I get bored with Pelican Town sometimes. But... I like that you're different. We balance each other out."
* {{choice|"Fun... Pelican Town seems really boring in comparison."|0}} "Oh really? I'm surprised... Didn't you move to Stardew Valley to escape the noise of the city? I mean... Don't get me wrong, I totally understand. My life in Pelican Town is pretty bland, you know."

His attention returns to the game when the Tunnelers make a play and score a goal. In a moment of excitement, Shane gives you a kiss, but then he feels embarrassed by it and apologizes for getting carried away. After a pause, you reply with a kiss and allay his fears. The scene pans to the northwest and fades and Shane briefly reflects on the evening.
}}

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|boys}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
|hearts = 14
|trigger = Enter town on a non-Friday between 8am and 5pm. For parts II and III enter town anytime each of the next two days.
|details = On the first day, Marnie, Jas, and yourself are outside of the saloon. Shane comes out of the bar, saying that he hasn't had a session like that in a while. Marnie looks worried, and asks you to talk to him next time he comes out of the saloon.

On the second day, Shane comes out and you confront him. Shane gets upset at the suggestion that he's been drinking, and runs home.

On the third day, Marnie and you are waiting outside the saloon, and Shane goes in. You try to catch him in the act of drinking, but he is instead standing in front of an arcade machine. Marnie is confused and asks about the cans on the floor, and Shane explains that they're Joja Cola cans. He also explains that playing video games helps him calm the urge to drink.

* {{choice|"I'm sorry, I should've believed you." |0 }} That's alright, (Player). You're just looking out for me. I get it. Look... I know I haven't been perfect... but, I'm trying my best... and I'm gonna keep trying. So you don't have to worry about me. My life is better now than it's ever been. I'm not in such a dark place anymore...
* {{choice|"I was worried!" |0 }}

Afterwards, Shane will say that you and Marnie must have been confused to see him in front of the arcade machine.
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Shane will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small chicken coop behind the farmhouse, where he'll sometimes go to visit with his chicken "Charlie".

On rainy days, Shane may offer you [[Beer]], [[Large Egg]], [[Pale Ale]], [[Void Egg]], or [[Pepper Poppers]].  On days when Shane stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you [[Omelet]], [[Pepper Poppers]], or [[Pizza]].

==Timeline==
Shane's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Shane's style changed over the years before the game was launched.
[[File:Shane Timeline.png|center]]

==Trivia==
* Judging by the 'Mega Station' console in Shane's bedroom, he is a gamer. Additionally, it is hooked up to a 'Code Sultan XL'.
* During Shane's second seven heart event, [[Clint]] says that "[[Joja Cola]] has three times the sorbitol for a thick, sweet, blast." The joke is that sorbitol is a thick, slightly sweet substance that when consumed in large quantities can cause gastrointestinal distress, with symptoms such as gas and diarrhea (both of which could be considered a "blast.")
* When married, he'll admit to wishing "that he was six inches taller". 
** When comparing the male sprites to each other during the [[Flower Dance]] cutscene, Shane is relatively shorter.
* He used to play for his high school's varsity gridball team.
* In [[Secret Notes#Secret Note #7|Secret Note #7]], it is confirmed that he is one of three 'older bachelors' in Pelican Town.
* Shane's original shirt appears to be based on a [https://www.soundersfc.com/ Seattle Sounders] soccer jersey.
* Even though he gives you the recipe for a [[Strange Bun]], it is only a neutral gift to him.
* Shane hates [[Joja Cola]] as a gift. Despite this, he will sometimes say "Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?", and he is seen surrounded by empty Joja Cola cans in his fourteen hearts event.

==History==
