{{Quote|Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend time outside, foraging for a wild meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the season. She’s a talented artist with a large portfolio of work… yet she’s too nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little confidence boost?|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Leah''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in a [[Leah's Cottage|small cottage]] outside [[Pelican Town]]. She's one of the twelve characters available to [[marriage|marry]]. 

She spends each morning sculpting inside her cottage. Her home opens at 10am and closes at 6pm, but during [[Spring]], [[Summer]], or [[Fall]], players must first acquire two hearts of [[friendship]] before being allowed inside. Players at any friendship level may enter during [[Winter]] between 10am and 6pm.

==Schedule==
After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Leah may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Leah will immediately go home to bed. Leah never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or her checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Shown below are Leah's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 2
 |trigger = Enter [[Leah's Cottage]] when she's there.
 |details = You see her working on a sculpture. She discusses sculpting with you, and says "Once you get past the outer layers, the true nature starts to show..."
* {{choice|"It's the same with people."|0}} she agrees and says "Oh! yeah, that's absolutely right!"
* {{choice|"I actually prefer the look of raw, unadulterated wood."|0}} She says that there's nothing wrong with that and that she thinks there's lots of beauty to be found in raw untouched nature. She goes on to say as a human, she is interested in how we shape and interpret the world around us, she explains this as she is interested in 'art'.
* {{choice|"(creepy) May I have a kiss?"|-100}}
** If the farmer is male, she calls you a pig, punches you and kicks you out. The scene ends.
** Otherwise, she acts surprised, saying "Oh! you're...? (blushing) Me too. That's good to know". Regardless of her blushing, she will hit you with her hammer and kick you out. The scene ends.
** '''WARNING:''' if you choose this option, '''you can never see Leah's 8-Heart event.''' Because you were creepy and missed the chance to make a suggestion for her art career, it will not be possible to trigger either version of her 8-Heart event in the future.
She continues, "Although, I have to admit... It's not easy to pay the bills as an artist."
* {{choice|"Why don't you have an art show in town?"|0}} She muses that it could help make Pelican Town a true art destination, but says she'd be crushed if nobody liked her sculptures. She says she'll think about it, and thanks you for stopping by. If you choose this option, then immediately talk to Leah after the cutscene, she'll say "An art show for the whole town? That's a bold idea, (Name)."
* {{choice|"Why don't you sell your art on the internet?"|0}} She notes that she would need a computer for that, but that they are expensive. She says she'll think about it, and thanks you for stopping by.
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 4
 |trigger = Enter [[Leah's Cottage]] when she's there.
 |details = You see her arguing with her ex-partner on the phone, who is asking her to come back to the city she left. After the call, she tells you her story and asks if it was selfish to move out of the city to be an artist.

* {{choice|"No, it had to be done."|0}} Leah responds, "You're right... I just wouldn't have been happy back there."
* {{choice|"No, and your ex sounds like an idiot."|0}} Leah responds, "That's a bit harsh... But yeah, we had different priorities."
* {{choice|"No, but you would've been better off staying in the city."|-20}}
* {{choice|"Yeah, a little."|-20}}
* {{choice|"Yeah, but it's natural to care about yourself first."|-20}}

Depending on your response in this conversation and the two-heart event, she'll either thank you for listening or briefly get angry. She tells you that she's been thinking about the art show or is saving for a computer, depending on your choice in the previous event.
}}

===Six Hearts I===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Leah is at your farmhouse door on any day but rainy between 6 AM and 11:30 AM.
 |details = Leah says she has a gift for you, and you receive the [[Leah's Sculpture|sculpture]] she's been working on. It's called ''How I Feel About &lt;your name>''. 
}}

===Six Hearts II===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Enter [[Cindersap Forest]] when Leah is there, in any season except winter.
 |details = Leah is trying to reach a fruit from the large tree above the forest lake. She can't reach it, so you lift her onto your shoulders. She thanks you and says that if her art ever fails, you'll always be there to catch her.

[[File:Leah Seven Hearts Rain 1.jpg|500px]]
}}

===Eight Hearts===
====Art Show====
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = If you suggested an art show in her two-heart event, Leah is at your farmhouse door between 6 AM and 8 AM (except in winter) to invite you to her art show. Enter [[Pelican Town]] between 3 PM and 5 PM (not necessarily the same day).
 |details = You arrive to find many others already present. Leah is happy to see you and nervously starts the art show. She thanks everyone for coming. Leah says she came to Pelican Town to draw inspiration from the beautiful surroundings and confesses that it really feels like home now. She presents her sculptures.

"I haven't named this one, yet. She started out as an exercise in human anatomy, but I ended up seeing her through to completion. Her expression is intentionally unclear... is she embarrassed, amused, pained? I'll leave that for you to decide." ''(pause)'' "This one's called 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace'. It represents the boundary of human imagination. The shape and color came to me vividly when I was in a 'trance state'." ''(pause'') "I've been calling this one 'Egg Heads'. I wanted to create an animatronic humanoid statue to toy with the viewer's ability to properly attribute personhood to a physical entity." ''(pause)'' "And the last one is called 'Wood Sculpture 3'. It's a celebration of my favorite sculpting material... wood."

Finally, she thanks her special friend (you), who gave her the idea for the art show and the courage to go through with it.

The villagers all praise Leah and her artwork:

* Lewis: "I'm proud of you, Leah! Events like this really breathe life into our little town!"
* Gus: "Great stuff!"
* Demetrius: "I love your art, Leah! 'Post-Dimensional Nullspace' is my favorite."
* Robin: "Great use of wood!"
* Penny: "Thanks for doing this!"

Leah thanks everyone, Lewis starts the bidding on the art pieces, and as the scene fades, her ex, Kel, can be seen to the side. Afterward, Leah says she's exhausted but that the show was a success.
}}

====Art Website====
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = If you suggested an art website in her two-heart event, enter [[Leah's Cottage]] when she's there.
 |details = Leah proudly tells you she bought a laptop and set up an online art shop like you suggested. Her computer plays a coin sound, and she excitedly says that means someone just bought something. She pauses and says there's a "Mr K" who keeps buying all her sculptures. She figures it must be "some rich guy" who loves her art. She thanks you for the idea and says it's been really successful so far, and is confident she'll have enough money to work on her art full-time now. She goes back to work on her store, tweaking the CSS sheets. 
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = Enter [[Cindersap Forest]] between 11 AM and 4 PM on a sunny day, in any season except winter.
 |details = Leah says she knew you'd be passing through the forest, and surprises you with a picnic. She thanks you for helping her get one step closer to being a real artist, and you share a kiss.

[[File:Kel.png|thumb|right|Kel]]Leah's ex-partner Kel comes out of the bushes. (Kel will be male or female depending on your player character's gender.) Leah is annoyed and asks "What the heck are you doing here?"
* If you suggested the art website, Kel says "I found your online art store... weren't you wondering about the 'Mr. K' who kept buying all your sculptures?" Leah is disappointed, because she thought it was "just a rich guy" who truly loved her art. Kel says she was "half right", implying that Kel doesn't care about her art. Kel says "I want you back. I miss you." Leah refuses, saying Kel was never interested in her art until she became successful.
* If you suggested the art show, Kel says "I came all the way from [[Setting#Zuzu City|Zuzu City]] to see your sculptures. ...And to get you to come back with me." Kel claims to want their relationship to be the way it was before. Leah refuses, saying Kel was never interested in her art until she became successful.
Either way, an argument ensues. You can choose to "Punch Kel in the face" or "Try reasoning with Kel". If you don't punch Kel, Leah does instead. If you do punch Kel, Leah says that Kel is fine but "That was pretty violent, (Name)."

Leah takes you to find a more secluded spot and admits the picnic didn't quite pan out like she'd wanted it to.
}}

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|girls}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger= Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 8:20am on a sunny day that isn't Sunday and isn't in winter.
 |details = Leah meets the player outside the farmhouse in the morning.

Part 2: The next sunny day (or any sunny day after that), enter the Forest between 11:30 am and 2:00pm.

Leah has asked you to paint a portrait of [[Marnie]] with her.

Leah asks you what style of portrait she should paint. "Hey, &lt;your name>... what style do you think I should do? I'm up for anything..."
* {{choice|Classic country portrait|0}}
* {{choice|Colorful, retro pop-art|0}}
* {{choice|Minimalist modern|0}}

She then asks how yours is coming along.
* {{choice|It's a masterpiece of fine art!}}
* {{choice|I'm trying my best...}}
* {{choice|It looks like chicken scratch}}

Leah shows you her painting, which is different depending on which option you picked. (Left to right: "Classic country portrait", "Colorful, retro pop-art", "Minimalist modern")

[[File:Leah's Paintings.png]]

You display your painting as well, which is less than flattering. 

[[File:My First Painting.png]]

Leah tells [[Marnie]] that she can keep both paintings, but [[Marnie]] says that you should keep your first painting - and only takes Leah's.

The sequence ends, and you now have [[My First Painting]] in your inventory. Leah's painting will also appear in Marnie's bedroom.
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Leah will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small area behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to work on a sculpture.

On rainy mornings, Leah may offer you a gift she found while "mushroom-hunting":  [[Chanterelle]], [[Common Mushroom]], [[Red Mushroom]], or [[Morel]].  On mornings when Leah stays indoors all day, she may offer you [[Coffee]] or a gift grown in "a little pot out back":  [[Wild Horseradish]], [[Daffodil]], [[Leek]], [[Dandelion]], [[Cactus Fruit]], [[Fiddlehead Fern]], [[Spice Berry]], or [[Sweet Pea]].  She may also offer you a [[Salad]] on days when she stays indoors all day.  On New Years' Eve (Winter 28), she'll give you a bottle of [[Wine]].
