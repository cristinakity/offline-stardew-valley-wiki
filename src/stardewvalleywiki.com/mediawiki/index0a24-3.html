== Galaxy Soul ==
The [[Galaxy Soul]] article states that during "dangerous mines" quests (Qi) unspecified enemies may drop that item. This article does not list the item, even in the Special Items subsection. It does not say whether or not it would also be a potential drop when a quest is not active but the "dangerous mines" toggle is set by the Shrine of Challenge. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 17:48, 13 April 2021 (UTC)

== Dangerous Monsters ==
Pages are all lacking speed info (except for Dangerous Squid Kid - thank you [[User:Snakebeast|Snakebeast]] for updating that!).

The relevant code is probably &lt;samp>StardewValley.Monsters.Monster::BuffForAdditionalDifficulty&lt;/samp>.  In this function/method, damage, HP, and defense are buffed, but there is no equation to change speed.  So, it is likely that all dangerous monsters have the same speed as their normal counterparts, unless the monster has a specific entry in the data file &lt;samp>Monsters.xnb&lt;/samp>.

If no one else is interested in updating the pages (or no one sees this note), I can work on changing the pages (I'll put it on my "to do" list...)  Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:08, 4 July 2021 (UTC)
:So it's same speed as the "weaker" version in '''every''' case? [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 22:06, 4 July 2021 (UTC)
:All pages should be updated now (most/many already were...). - [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 22:38, 4 July 2021 (UTC)
::Some monsters have no weaker version (like the Blue Squid), and some have their own entry in &lt;samp>Monsters.xnb&lt;/samp>, like the [[Royal Serpent]].  The Skeleton Mage has a weaker counterpart that is unimplemented, but the speed should be what is in the data file. Other than those exceptions, all dangerous monsters should have the same speed as the weaker counterpart.  
::Thanks for updating the pages, I appreciate it!! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 03:00, 5 July 2021 (UTC)

== Dangerous mines ==
Can someone please add more info on the dangerous mines (eg how often beach foragables spawn, brief descriptions of the different areas). [[User:Corndrology]] ([[User talk:Corndrology|talk]]) 06:11, 30 October 2021
:That sounds like a great idea for a separate page. I wouldn't want to see a second table of "Floors" for example, on the main page, but it would work as its own page. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:09, 30 October 2021 (UTC)
::Also note Dangerous monsters are already listed on the [[Monsters]] page. -- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 16:41, 30 October 2021 (UTC)

== Weeds for floors 100 and 120 ==
The game has weeds above the floor on these floors, with the wiki not saying it makes me look suspicious. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:50, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
:Floors 100 &amp; 120 can never have weeds, but floors 101-109 can, and it already says that on the page. Floors 111-119 shouldn't have weeds. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:48, 13 July 2022 (UTC)

== Page for Dangerous Mines ==
Just letting you know that I've created a page for The Dangerous Mines as you thought it was a great idea. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:06, 15 July 2022 (UTC)
:Turns out it doesn't work so well as a separate page, if almost all the information is the same as on [[The Mines]] page... [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:45, 15 July 2022 (UTC)

==Ladders from Rocks Formula==
I feel like the ladder drop chance from rocks could be expressed a lot more concisely as a formula rather than a paragraph, like the chance of treasure rooms in Skull Cavern. 

Base chance: &lt;code>0.02 + (2 x Daily Luck) + (Luck Buffs / 100) + (1 / # of Rocks Remaining)&lt;/code>

Chance with no enemies: &lt;code>0.06 + (2 x Daily Luck) + (Luck Buffs / 100) + (1 / # of Rocks Remaining)&lt;/code>

As it is currently it feels clunky and hard to follow, plus it's inconsistent with the way other probabilities are presented. [[User:Leninheads|Leninheads]] ([[User talk:Leninheads|talk]]) 18:51, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
:That seems like a fine change; my only concerns are deleting the words pointing out that the Special Charm affects daily luck (although I'm not sure where 0.5% comes from, it seems like it should be 0.05 = 5%?) and the fact that food/drink buffs add 1% for every point of Luck. (The paragraph should say food/drink buffs or simply luck buffs, as you have in your equations.) Let's also not lose the part about a ladder spawn preventing another one from spawning by breaking a rock in the mines, and the whole bit about shafts in the Skull Cavern. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:47, 21 July 2022 (UTC)
::0.5% from special charm is correct, it should be 0.2 x daily luck, not 2, sorry about that. Would it make sense to add similar clarifications about what daily luck and luck buffs are to the treasure rooms section? [[User:Leninheads|Leninheads]] ([[User talk:Leninheads|talk]]) 23:09, 21 July 2022 (UTC)
:::On the [[Skull Cavern]] page? No, I don't think so, there are links to [[Luck]] and the "Buffs" section of Luck already on the page, that appear before the equations are presented to the reader. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:54, 22 July 2022 (UTC)
::::Agreed that it was clunky and hard to follow. I made some edits to the Ladders section for readability, does it read more clearly now? Personally, a math formula does not help me as a human understand conceptually how big of an impact each variable has; for example, glancing at (2 x Daily Luck) vs. (1 / # of Rocks Remaining), it's hard to tell which of those numbers is actually bigger -- it turns out that remaining rocks is MUCH more important than daily luck and that seems best explained in words. [[User:Cooperka|Cooperka]] ([[User talk:Cooperka|talk]]) 01:47, 10 April 2023 (UTC)

== Monsters become stronger? ==
The article says after reaching the bottom of them mines, ''some monsters will be stronger''. I haven't been able to find how exactly monsters are stronger. There's absolutely no discussion online about this. Any help? --[[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 07:31, 24 July 2022 (UTC)
:This is definitely a question for Pathoschild. I've looked through the code, and am not finding anything helpful atm. Please post a message on his [[User talk:Pathoschild|talk page]]. Thanks! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:23, 24 July 2022 (UTC)

::I just dug through the code and noticed &lt;samp>Monsters.Monster::parseMonsterInfo&lt;/samp>. There's an conditional block that does the following:

::&lt;pre>resilience.Value += resilience.Value / 2;
::missChance.Value *= 2.0;
::Health += Game1.random.Next(0, Health);
::DamageToFarmer += Game1.random.Next(0, DamageToFarmer / 2);
::coinsToDrop.Value += Game1.random.Next(0, (int)coinsToDrop + 1);&lt;/pre>

::So in human words,
::* "Resilience" is bumped by 50% (maybe it's monster's [[Defense]]?)
::* Chance for missing a hit is doubled
::* HP is increased by a random value between 0 and 100% 
::* Damage is increased by a random value between 0 and 50%
::* "Coins to drop" is increased by a random value between 0 and 100% (but what the heck is this?)
::- [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 17:56, 24 July 2022 (UTC)

:::Nice work! Now that you've found it, you can compare the indices with [[Modding:Monster data]], which explains the fields in some more depth. "Coins to drop" is unimplemented. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:57, 25 July 2022 (UTC)

== Files for floor layouts ==

Since of some text in wiki pages saying layouts for floors in The Mines and the [[Skull Cavern]], would it make sense if we uploaded files of the floor layouts and the themes? Because I want to see what they look like without going on the game to see them. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:48, 26 July 2022 (UTC)
:Your best bet is youtube or twitch for that. If you like, you can [[Modding:Editing XNB files#Unpack game files|unpack the data files]] and look at the floor layouts there too. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:05, 26 July 2022 (UTC)
::I have them in a folder here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15ZwEUPe6KLVgakM35ivqb-koJo0ruXcz?usp=sharing [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 21:38, 26 July 2022 (UTC)

== Removed Dangerous Mines page ==

Since of you removing the page called: "The Dangerous Mines" as you thought it did not work so well being a page. Well, when you removed the page, I actually forgot to add proper information to the page. Here is some examples: a Monster List, Crates and Barrels, and Special items. Also there was a bug with dungeon levels where when [[Haunted Skull]]s kept spawning on a dungeon level, it would be its [[Haunted Skull|regular variant]] rather than its [[Haunted Skull (dangerous)|dangerous variant]]. So what do you think? should it be added back of no? I'll let you decide. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:04, 13 August 2022 (UTC)

== Dungeon floors being infested floors ==

Since of me playing in 2020 and people on YouTube, before v1.5 was introduced, some dungeon floors were infested floors, this also included floors 2-4, 42-44, and 82-44, 19, 59, and 99, 31-39, 71-79, and 111-119. So were infested floors on dungeon floors removed in v1.5 because I've have not found any floors being infested floors. IBugOne also made the change that they are never infested floors, feel free to check the game code for research. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:04, 29 August 2022 (UTC)

:This is one of the minor changes in 1.5. Here's the code diff from v1.4.5 (which I spent a good effort to grab from Steam) to v1.5.6 (current):

&lt;pre>
@@ -2094,69 +2374,112 @@
    }
    if (this.isQuarryArea || this.getMineArea(level) == 77377)
    {
-     ((NetFieldBase&lt;string, NetString>)(object)this.mapImageSource).set_Value("Maps\\Mines\\mine_quarryshaft");
-     int numBrownSpots = base.map.get_Layers()[0].get_LayerWidth() * base.map.get_Layers()[0].get_LayerHeight() / 100;
+     this.mapImageSource.Value = "Maps\\Mines\\mine_quarryshaft";
+     int numBrownSpots = base.map.Layers[0].LayerWidth * base.map.Layers[0].LayerHeight / 100;
      this.isQuarryArea = true;
      this.isSlimeArea = false;
+     this.isMonsterArea = false;
      this.isDinoArea = false;
      for (int i = 0; i &lt; numBrownSpots; i++)
      {

&lt;/pre>

While there's a 25% chance for a quarry floor to generate as infested (&lt;samp>isMonsterArea&lt;/samp>), v1.5 explicitly resets that flag to &lt;samp>false&lt;/samp> to prevent that from happening. - [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 15:52, 29 August 2022 (UTC)

== Blue slimes spawning on floors 1-29 ==

Since of us playing and me finding blue slimes in these floors is making me look confused because floors 1-29 should never spawn blue slimes. Feel free to check the game code for research about slimes. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:10, 30 September 2022 (UTC)
:Please read the section of the page [[Slimes#Variations]], for "Blue Slime (Frost Jelly)", please read what it says under "Location". [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:42, 30 September 2022 (UTC)
::What I found was "But can sometimes be found on other floors." That is all I found on the page. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:26, 1 October 2022 (UTC)

== Difficulty levels ==

Should a note be added that the mines actually have 3 different difficulty levels? The added difficulty of the Shrine of Challenge and the Danger in the Deep quest are capable of stacking if you have the Shrine of Challenge active when you accept the Danger in the Deep quest. This allows the difficulty level to be 0 (neither active), 1 (1 xor the other active) or 2 (both active). While most checks just check if it is 0 or greater than 0, some actually use it as a number. Quickly checking through the code, I see that it increases the chance of finding radioactive ore, monsters spawning, slimes spawning as stacked slimes, leapers having partners, monsters in the mines to drop diamonds and prismatic shards; as well as buffing monsters (more damage, more health, more resilience).

:Short answer: yes, please! Long answer: yes, but keep it short and simple, as it may (or may not) change with v1.6. 
:I think it would be best as a separate heading, but as an h2 by itself (two equals signs), or an h3 (three equals signs) under the h2 "Contents"? I don't know, you can decide. Either would be fine, I think. Thank you! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:23, 7 May 2023 (UTC)

== Bottom of the mines effects ==

While checking a few things, I decided to look up where the number of times the player has reached the bottom of the mines is used, to see if there are cumulative effects, and noticed some things are more controlled by reaching floor 40 or 80 instead, and some extra things not listed are changed. I'm not sure if it would be best to change the bottom of the mines section into a key floors section and add in notes about reaching floor 40 and floor 80 as well, or put floor 40 and floor 80 into a different section. This could also be a more general "progress", which also highlights elevators every 5 floors, and links to the adventurers guild page with a note saying weapons unlock as you go deeper.

I found that &lt;code>StardewValley.Utility::getStardewHeroCelebrationEventString&lt;/code> has &lt;code>((Game1.player.timesReachedMineBottom > 0) ? " Dwarf 19 24 0" : "")&lt;/code>. However I don't think this is actually called anywhere in the game (other than debug).

I also found that while technically it is checked in &lt;code>StardewValley.Utility::getRandomItemFromSeason&lt;/code>, directly before this (combined with logical or) it checks if you have reached floor 40 (adding aquamarine, jade, diamond, frozen tear and purple mushrooms) or floor 80 (adding ruby, emerald and fire quartz). So I think that line from the bottom of the mines section is technically incorrect.

In &lt;code>StardewValley.Objects.BreakableContainer::releaseContents&lt;/code>, it changes what will drop from breakable containers. Only for those in MP (as it needs difficulty>1) it replaces a chance to get sap (92) or basic retaining soil (370) with a frozen tear (84). For everyone, when the mines aren't difficult, depending on the container, it instead replaces sap or basic retaining soil with quartz (80) for container 118; frozen tear (84) for container 120; and for container 122 or 124 it changes one of the 3 possibilities for cave carrot (78) to fire quartz (82).

In &lt;code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::checkStoneForItems&lt;/code> for the gem node (44), it controls what gems may drop in a similar manner to &lt;code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getRandomGemRichStoneForThisLevel&lt;/code> chooses which gem stone ore to use. If the player has reached the bottom, there is a 1 in 11 chance for jade, and a 2 in 11 chance for each of emerald, aquamarine, ruby, amethyst and topaz. If the player has not reached floor 40 there is a 50-50 chance of getting either amethyst or topaz. If they player has not yet reached floor 80, then there is a complex chance where the 2 in 11 chance for emerald and ruby are replaced by an equal chance of the other 4 gems, resulting in an 18.2% chance to get jade, and a 27.3% chance to get aquamarine, amethyst or topaz.

While insignificant for normal gameplay, it does change the random seed for cutting down grass, and for the crystalRandom in &lt;code>StardewValley.TerrainFeatures.Quartz::performToolAction&lt;/code>, and for the levelRandom in the apparently unused &lt;code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getCrystalColorForThisLevel&lt;/code>

Other things affected by level include what weapons are unlocked in the adventurers guild; which monsters are to be slain for monster slayer quests; if a help wanted quest can request gold (level 40) and going above floor 25 means half the copper ore drops from regular geodes become iron ore, and above floor 75 half the iron ore drops from frozen geodes become gold ore.

:I would like to make a correction to the above. While &lt;code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::checkStoneForItems&lt;/code> does check what floor you have reached to reassign the gem node, that code is unreachable as before that it called &lt;code>StardewValley.GameLocation::breakStone&lt;/code>, in which it replaces stone 44 with a randomly selected gem stone ore, including diamond. So if you have a gem node generate on level 1 of the mines the first time you enter the mines, it is possible for that to drop a diamond. This means it is only the gem stone ore which is affected, not the gem node. [[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 22:09, 8 May 2023 (UTC)

== Adding monster images to the Mines (dangerous) section. ==

Images needed for Red Slime (dangerous) and Frost Jelly (dangerous).
:Images would be great, but they're not strictly "needed". Please remember to sign your posts by typing 4 tildes &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>~~~~&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code> so we know who's doing the requesting! Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:50, 20 September 2023 (UTC)

== Reward chest spawning items ==

Unsure if this should be a bug or is a feature, but I had a red reward chest on level 20 turn into to House Plant item after emptying the chest of a remixed reward (wooden club) and then clicking on the chest to remove the chest.
I can't find anyone else mentioning this so I'm not sure if just a random situation, but if so it could be included in the bugs section?
What do people think? [[User:Tastyfish|Tastyfish]] ([[User talk:Tastyfish|talk]]) 18:38, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
:Bugs need to be reported on [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/ the official forums] first, not the wiki. The devs don't monitor the wiki for bug reports, but they do monitor the forums. You can also see if anyone else has experienced something similar by searching, or by posting and waiting for any responses. I've not heard of this bug myself, but others on the forums may have. Good luck! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:43, 21 October 2023 (UTC)

Thanks Margotbean, I didn't know that, I'm pretty new to the wiki side of things!  This was really helpful :) [[User:Tastyfish|Tastyfish]] ([[User talk:Tastyfish|talk]]) 18:46, 21 October 2023 (UTC)

== Dangerous Dungeon floors ==

Just wanted to clarify the correction I made on the page.
In the chooseStoneType function, the first check is for radioactive ore including by checking if the mines are dangerous, which uses the mine level to determine it is at the mine.
Then it goes through different mine areas, determining which ore/rocks to populate there. Inside each of the normal areas (0,10,40 and 80), it has a check for if it is a dangerous level to change what is returned.
However to determine the mine area first checks if it is a "quarry level", which is what these dungeon floors are, and if so returns 77377.
There is no check for a dangerous floor for the the area 77377.
This means other than radioactive ore which is dealt with at the start; the rocks that appear on dungeon floors will be the same regardless of if the mines are dangerous.[[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 22:08, 5 January 2024 (UTC)
:Thanks very much for the clarification, Jack! (And correcting my edit.) Much appreciated! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:22, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

== [[Slimes#Special Slimes|Special Slime]] and [[Slimes#Dangerous Slimes|Stacked Slime]] images to the Dangerous section ==

Images needed for Special Red Slime (dangerous), Special Blue Slime (dangerous), Special Purple Slime (dangerous), Stacked Red Slimes, Stacked Blue Slimes, and Stacked Purple Slimes. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 5:35, 13 January 2024 (UTC)
:Why? [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:52, 13 January 2024 (UTC)

::It's so we have every colour of [[Slimes]], including their [[Slimes#Dangerous Slimes|Dangerous]] and [[Slimes#Special Slimes|Special]] variants in the Wiki. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 4:14, 14 January 2024 (UTC)

== Crates drop staircases? == 
I've had staircases drop from crates multiple times in the dangerous version of the mines, but I can't find this mentioned anywhere. Should the drop table be updated? [[User:YellowLink10|YellowLink10]] ([[User talk:YellowLink10|talk]]) 20:40, 17 February 2024 (UTC)
:The game code says that shouldn't be possible, so file a bug report on [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/ the official forums], and don't forget to include platform, version, and single-player or multiplayer.

== Magnet Ring Chance as Special Item on Floors 40-59 ==
As [[User:9000|9000]] pointed out in an edit summary, the magnet ring is missing a probability in the special items table, floors 40-59. [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]] suggested the chance might have been too complicated to calculate, but according to &lt;code>MineShaft::getSpecialItemForThisMineLevel&lt;/code>, the probability is indeed 1 in 7 (or 14% after rounding), since all special items in these levels are equally likely. (In fact, all special items within a given level range of the mines are equally likely, with the exception of levels 80-99 in which the Yeti Sword is twice as likely as other items). Should this be added to the table? The game code is already cited for the entire table in the text above it. —[[User:Gravy|Gravy]] ([[User talk:Gravy|talk]]) 12:05, 23 February 2024 (UTC)
:Yes, if you've looked at the code and believe it to be correct, then definitely yes! As you said, there's already a code reference on the page that covers the content of the entire table, so it's fine. Thank you for taking the time to look at the code! Please go ahead and make the change. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:30, 23 February 2024 (UTC)
