sorry if I did this wrong; I couldn't figure out how to post something individually. I also didn't find any rules on how to submit a comment. Under "quality" it says every tree in a 7x7 area is counted, and mossy trees count twice. It says the product is divided by 40, then if the quotient is 40 iridium quality is guaranteed. According to this, you would have to plant EIGHT HUNDRED trees (with moss) for this. Was this a typo, or is this the way of saying it's not possible to guarantee iridium quality?

"The count" in this page refers to the number of trees and mosses, before divided by 40. So if you plant 40 trees (or trees + moss), the chance = 40/40 =100% to make sure iridium.[[User:Ethan|Ethan]] ([[User talk:Ethan|talk]]) 08:03, 13 April 2024 (UTC)

This page mentions a Birch Tree which I don't think exist in game? Was this intended to mean mahogany?

[[User:Numberland|Numberland]] ([[User talk:Numberland|talk]]) 04:20, 28 March 2024 (UTC)

Yeah sorry mb meant Maple its fixed now [[User:Explodingpineapple64|Explodingpineapple64]] ([[User talk:Explodingpineapple64|talk]]) 15:54, 28 March 2024 (UTC)

== optimal layouts ==

srry if im doing this wrong, never edited a wiki before.
been keeping an eye on popular mushroom log layouts, and i designed my own which i was told to submit to the wiki since it's "one of the best example layouts i have seen for this game". i'll post it here and someone who knows what they're actually doing can judge whether or not it should be on the main page. 
my layout relies on being a keyboard and mouse user, and there's two different layouts depending on how compact each individual wants the farm to be. the grid of trees can be extended on the outside to maximise production on the outer row of logs, but further testing should be done to check if this is actually needed or not. 

[[User:Ikako|Ikako]] ([[User talk:Ikako|talk]]) 21:50, 6 April 2024 (UTC)
update: this version has the extended grid of trees i mentioned

[[User:Ikako|Ikako]] ([[User talk:Ikako|talk]]) 22:23, 6 April 2024 (UTC)
ok well i came up with a much better layout after a ton of testing. the trees do not have to be fully grown to count towards the 10-tree limit, so there are no restrictions on their placement.

[[User:Ikako|Ikako]] ([[User talk:Ikako|talk]]) 21:24, 9 April 2024 (UTC)
:Thanks, but images with English only are no good, as the wiki exists in 12 languages. Once you feel you are certain that the layout is optimized, you can upload an image like the black &amp; white ones you see on the [[Greenhouse]] page, under "Sprinklers". Please make sure it has a descriptive file name at that time. Thanks! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:11, 10 April 2024 (UTC)

== Quantity == 

I'm trying to calculate expected profits for mushroom logs, so I looked at the game code, and in particular the random number used to generate the quantity of mushrooms. The wiki says it's "a random number between 0.5 and 1.5". The game code uses "Game1.random.Next(1, 3) * (nearbyTrees.Count / 2)". Looking up the definition, the documentation of Next(int minValue, int maxValue) gives us: "A 32-bit signed integer greater than or equal to minValue and less than maxValue; that is, the range of return values includes minValue but not maxValue." So it's exclusive and generates one of two integers: either 1 or 2. Meaning the random number would be 0.5 or 1, with a 50% chance of either one happening. Could someone double check me? This is the first time I'm reading C# and I also don't understand why "Game1.random.Next(1, 3) * (nearbyTrees.Count / 2)" would always be an integer. [[User:Lc-hobby|Lc-hobby]] ([[User talk:Lc-hobby|talk]]) 13:03, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

I think I calculated the expected number of mushrooms spawned per number of trees in the 7x7 square. random.Next maxvalue is exclusive, so random nr is either 1 or 2. n_trees/2 is rounded towards 0 (integer division). So n_trees/2 is [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5] for 0 throuh 10 n_trees. With random.Next(1,3) equal to 1 and 2 respectively, we have [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5] and [1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5,5,5] mushrooms produced. Hence the expected value of the number of mushrooms for 0 to 10 trees is [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5] + [1,1,2,2,4,4,5,5,5,5,5] / 2 = [1,1,1.5,1.5,3,3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5]. So interestingly, due to the rounding down towards 0 in the integer division, 3, 5, 7, and 9 trees do not add any benefit to the number of mushrooms when compared to 2, 4, 6, and 8 trees in the 7x7 square.

== Locations: Permanent or Not? ==

Can a Mushroom Log be moved? (By using a tool?) Or is it destroyed when chopped? And if destroyed, are there any resources left behind to pick up? [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 03:24, 15 May 2024 (UTC)
