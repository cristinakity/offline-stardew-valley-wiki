{{Quote|I'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring. I made these clothes from scratch.|Emily}}

[[Emily]] is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in [[Pelican Town]].  She's one of the twelve characters available to [[Marriage|marry]].  Her home is south of the town square, right next to [[Jodi]]'s house, at the address [[2 Willow Lane]]. She works most evenings at [[The Stardrop Saloon]] starting at about 4:00 PM. 

Emily loves to make her own clothing, but fabric can be difficult to come by in town. Among her favorite [[friendship|gifts]] are [[cloth]] and [[wool]].

==Schedule==
{{Spoiler}}
After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Emily may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Emily will immediately go home to bed. Emily never visits the Resort on [[Fall]] 15, [[Festivals|Festival]] days, or her checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Shown below are Emily's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others below it.

==Relationships==
Emily lives with her sister [[Haley]], and together they care for their [[2 Willow Lane|parents' home]], who have been traveling the world for the past two years. She works with [[Gus]], who employs her part-time at [[The Stardrop Saloon|the saloon]].
 
She is also friends with [[Sandy]], the two mention each other in dialogues, and she visits [[The Desert|The Calico Desert]] on Sandy's birthday each year. [[Sandy]], at her first meeting with the player, claims to have been aware of the farmer's presence even before access to [[The Desert|The Calico Desert]] was opened, saying that Emily had written to her about the newcomer.

Several dialogues and cutscenes reveal that [[Clint]] has romantic interest in Emily, though he is too shy to tell her.

She will dance with [[Shane]] at the [[Flower Dance]] if neither of them are dancing with the player.

At any [[friendship]] level greater than zero friendship points, you may receive a gift in the mail from Emily.  The chance of receiving a gift in the mail increases as your friendship with Emily increases.

===Two Hearts===
{{Hearts|2}}

Enter [[2 Willow Lane|Emily's house]] when she's there.

{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
| Emily is asleep in her room. The screen pans to the north and fades, and you find yourself viewing Emily's dream. It's a dreamscape of abstract shapes and colors, clouds, and palm trees. Emily floats above a purple stone structure on a large cloud. She is floating, meditating and chanting "power words." You appear out of the cloud, surprising her. She wonders what you are doing in her dream. Rainbow streaks fly by and she sees them as some kind of sign or omen. You disappear and she wakes up. She gets out of bed and says to herself that there is something special about you; she believes that your destinies are somehow intertwined.

===Four Hearts===
{{Hearts|4}}

Enter town on a sunny day. Cannot be triggered in [[winter]].

{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
| Emily leaves her house on a sunny day. Three parrots fly by, and she waves and refers to them as her "friends". After a moment, she continues walking but quickly stops, confused. A fourth parrot flys in too low and smacks against the window of her house. The parrot is injured. Emily rushes over and cradles the poor thing, promising that she will take care of it. Emily will now have a parrot in her room. The parrot hops around and will squawk if you go up to it and press the "check" button.

(If you marry Emily, the parrot will move into your house as well.)
|}

===Six Hearts===
{{Hearts|6}}

Enter [[2 Willow Lane|Emily's house]] when she's there.

You'll enter Emily's room.  She tells you that she is excited to show you her secret hobby that she has been working on for a long time.  She'll then proceed to turn on her stereo and begin dancing for you.  After the lights and music end it will ask you what you thought of the performance. You have three choices:
*{{Choice|"That was amazing!"|25}}
*{{Choice|"That was embarrassing..."|-50}}
*{{Choice|''(Say nothing and do a slow clap)''|25}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{Hearts|8}}

A letter in the mail will invite the player to the [[Mayor's Manor]] that day during open hours. The event will be available on subsequent days if not seen the same day as the letter arrives.

Note: This event will not trigger until the player has seen Emily's 6-Heart Event.
{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
| Emily will send you a letter in the Mail, inviting you to attend her "Clothing Therapy" session:
{{Quote|[Player],
I have this crazy new idea that I want to involve
you in... It's called "Clothing Therapy".

Please come to the Mayor's house today to see what
it's all about.

Love, Emily}}

Enter the Mayor's house. Emily will explain the purpose is to help the townspeople express their true selves in the form of clothing. Attending are [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]], [[Abigail]], [[Shane]], [[Robin]], and [[Clint]]. Each one takes a turn going behind the curtain. Emily instructs them to choose whatever clothes "speaks to them", put it on and then show the world without fear. One by one, you get to see each character's choice. [[Shane]] puts on a full "goth" outfit. [[Robin]] puts on a fine dress and lets her hair down, embracing her feminine side. Mayor [[Lewis]] comes out with a fancy hat, cape, and cane. [[Abigail]] comes out in a full suit of armor. [[Clint]] is apprehensive about the whole thing, but after Emily coaxes him, he goes ahead. He comes out in the [[Tailoring#Shirts|Gaudy Shirt]], pink shorts and a beret. Emily sees it and says  "Awww... cute!", which makes [[Clint]] sad. After he is gone, Emily approaches you with romantic interest. [[Clint]] bursts in, saying he's too embarrassed to go out in his new outfit. He sees what's going on and feels awful. He makes some indirect remarks about it and leaves. Emily is confused.
|}

===Ten Hearts===
Note: Emily's 10 heart event seems to be bugged as of 1.6
Player's report not receiving the letter inviting the player into the Secret woods.

{{Heart event
|hearts =10
|trigger= A letter will invite the player to meet Emily in the [[Secret Woods]] after 10pm that night.

You will need a [[Axes|Steel Axe]] in order to break the [[Large Log]] blocking the entrance to the Secret Woods. If you do not have a Steel Axe, do not worry, as the heart event will trigger whenever you next go into the Secret Woods after 10 pm and when it is not raining or a festival day.

After triggering the cut-scene, the night will immediately end for the player.

|details= You go camping with Emily in the [[Secret Woods]]. There is strange grunting coming from the forest. She says it's cold and snuggles up close to you by the fire. A bear comes out of the woods and approaches your campsite. It grunts loudly and you both jump and dive into the tent. The bear sniffs around and leaves. Emily says that one of the sleeping bags is still out there, and she's not willing to go out and get it... so you have to share a bag. You hear movement in the tent, the screen fades and the day ends.

The next day, the player receives a letter from Emily, saying 
{{Quote|Thanks for joining me last night... I had a great time.&lt;br />I'm actually glad that bear showed up!&lt;br />&lt;br />See you soon&lt;br />&lt;br />  Love, Emily}}
}}

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|girls}}

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger= Exit the farmhouse between 6am and 8:20am.
 |details = Emily will appear outside the farmhouse and provide a quest to bring her 200 pieces of [[fiber]].  The quest is called "Errand for your Wife".

After completing the quest and waiting 3 days, enter the farmhouse between 8pm and midnight.  Emily will give you a new outfit consisting of [[Emily's Magic Hat]], [[Emily's Magic Boots]], [[Emily's Magic Shirt]], and a pair of matching blue [[Tailoring|Genie Pants]].
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Emily will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small crystal garden behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to meditate.  Note that [[Emily]]'s parrot will not be visible to anyone in [[multiplayer]] who has not completed her 4 heart event.

On rainy mornings, Emily may offer you [[Cloth]], [[Wool]], [[Duck Feather]], [[Refined Quartz]], or [[Bean Hotpot]].  On rainy nights, she may offer you dessert that is "raw", "gluten-free", and "sweetened only with cactus syrup":  [[Rice Pudding]], [[Blueberry Tart]], [[Cookie]], or [[Chocolate Cake]].  On days when Emily stays inside the farmhouse all day, she may offer you [[Cloth]], [[Wool]], [[Duck Feather]], [[Refined Quartz]], [[Bean Hotpot]], [[Coffee]], or an [[Omni Geode]].
