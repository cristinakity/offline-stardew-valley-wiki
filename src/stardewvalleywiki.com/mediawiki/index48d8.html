==Telephone==
Too much copy-pasting, my brain is fried. Thank you for correcting my mistakes on the Telephone page! [[User:Efarn|Efarn]] ([[User talk:Efarn|talk]]) 01:32, 28 February 2021 (UTC)
: No problem! [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 02:27, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

Why did you delete my input? I can't buy phone yet, so I was looking for answers to why, and the way I understood it, is that we have to complete Monster Eradication Goals first, or why can't I buy it??  [[User:IvanDK|IvanDK]] ([[User talk:IvanDK|talk]]) 09:26, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
: I reverted the change because it is false info. The telephone is available right from the start with no prior requirements. You can see at the bottom of the page it was introduced in 1.5 so it will not exist in the game at all in any version before 1.5 - therefore it does not exist on mobile platforms or on Vita. Where did you get the information about monster eradication goals? [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 09:31, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
::It was just me that misunderstood it, sorry it was only to get Marlon's phone number. Thanks for correcting my mistake quickly.. Sorry..  [[User:IvanDK|IvanDK]] ([[User talk:IvanDK|talk]]) 09:37, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
::: No problem! Marlon's phone number requirement was already listed as well as the requirements of some specific incoming calls [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 09:44, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

==Slime Hutch image==
Hello Dubesor!  I've reverted the original image [[:File:Slime safe farm.png]] to your version, and deleted the new image.  There's a cloudflare error preventing the current version of the image from showing up, but it should be resolved in a couple of days.  I'd prefer to wait, and keep the old image name, so all 12 wikis will be updated with the new image automatically.  The server people are aware of the problem, so I'm looking forward to the fix happening this week.  Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:58, 2 March 2021 (UTC)
: ah, thanks. I thought I was too stupid to update/doing something wrong. Good to know! :D [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 00:04, 3 March 2021 (UTC)

== "Coat of many colors" ==

I am doing a project on the wiki for margotbean by adding shorcuts to emily, haley, and their house to all items usable to turn into dye at the dye pots. I could use any help I can get, but it is okay if you don't want to! [[User:Fnaticlyric560|Fnaticlyric560]] ([[User talk:Fnaticlyric560|talk]]) 19:26, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

If you want to help, do the color list below the color underneath red. Thank you! [[User:Fnaticlyric560|Fnaticlyric560]] ([[User talk:Fnaticlyric560|talk]]) 19:32, 6 September 2021 (UTC)

: Hey. I'm currently not really motivated to edit the wiki due to [[User_talk:Margotbean/Archive_2021_Feb_-_Dec#You_are_abusing_your_admin.27s_right|reasons mentioned before]]. Adding the colour information on the item pages themselves seems like a good idea, but doesn't seem like a pressing thing that needs immediate attention. Don't worry if it takes a bit until it's present on all pages. I'll add it on to-do list, too. Meanwhile, the information is also visible on [[Dyeing]] and as a rule of thumb the colour will be whatever the dominant colour of the art is. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 23:42, 7 September 2021 (UTC)


==Pirates Cove Golden Walnut==
Hello :) I'm trying to understand your message in the recent reversion to my edit - '36_26 has hint "NutHint_SouthEastBuried", see line 198 in IslandHut.cs::ShowNutHint' I'm not sure where IslandHut.cs is and I"d like to know more.
[[User:Lildoggo|Lildoggo]] ([[User talk:Lildoggo|talk]]) 08:07, 27 May 2022 (UTC)
:Hi. If the nut didn't already have a hint, your revision would have been correct, but the nut you added (buried in pirate cove (36_26)) already has a hint "[Quantity] buried... Pirate's cove..." and thus didn't belong on the exception note. I just referenced the code in case someone wanted to check. The modding section has additional infos on working with game files, e.g. [[Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files|Unpack game files]] and [[Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started#How_do_I_decompile_the_game_code.3F|How do I decompile the game code?]] [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 08:31, 27 May 2022 (UTC)

Okay I see, thanks for the explanation. I made the edit because the hint did not come up - I found the walnut by checking every location listed in the wiki until I found the pirate's cove one. It is interesting that the hint did not come up for me, but perhaps it has come up for others? If it's referenced in the game code it will be hard for me to prove that this occurred :/ regardless, I suppose it could be a bug or maybe I just did something wrong, probably not worth much time to pursue further but I appreciate the time you put into this wiki and edits like mine :) [[User:Lildoggo|Lildoggo]] ([[User talk:Lildoggo|talk]]) 11:06, 30 May 2022 (UTC)
:&lt;!-- this is a case where indentation can be changed to level 3+4 without abusive change of the context/target -->Huh, weird. What platform &amp; version was this on? With only the one nut left, did you attempt to speak to the parrot on multiple days or only once when no hint appeared? It's completely possible that the hint is bugged under certain conditions, I am not exactly an expert at reading the decompiled code. I will now also test if I can trigger the hint for that specific nut ingame. And the time I put into the wiki is paid off when I see non-English speaking family members constantly getting information from the pages I translated :D [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 11:55, 30 May 2022 (UTC)

==Malicious content==
Hello Dubesor. You've made your dislike for me well known, but I remain one of the admins of the wiki. My edits are not intended to be malicious, but to keep some semblance of order across wikis. Comment like "Don't maliciously edit the context of my contributions again" are hostile, and violate the terms of the wiki. Thus, they may lead to temporary or permanent banning. 

I've made the reasons for the identation on the file talk page quite clear. You're welcome to contribute to the wiki, as long as you can leave hostility out of it. Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:13, 29 May 2022 (UTC)
:First of all, this is a comment written by me, with my signature, not a content page nor subjective content dispute. Comments on a talk page from another author should not be edited to change content or context. You [[File_talk:TownDistances.png|changed my reply]] towards Thamster on a talk page to being a reply towards yourself and used that to start a dialogue that I am simply not interested in. 
:I reverted my comment back to the original, correct and intended indentation, with a link showcasing correct use of indentation: ''"restore [[wikipedia:Help:Talk_pages#Replying_to_an_existing_thread|indentation]]; my reply was towards Thamster, not margotbean"''
:Again you alter my comment to a reply to yourself with this comment: ''"Each comment is indented by one"'' - this statement is simply false. Comments are indented by one more level, however this is based on the targeted source comment. My target was the base comment, thus the correct indentation is level one.
:I restore my comment and link the correct procedure: ''"It's not simply increased, it's based on which [[wikipedia:Wikipedia:Indentation#Indentation_examples|comment it's intended to reply to]] I intended to reply to the first post, not you. Don't maliciously edit the context of my contributions again."'' 
:By this point you ARE maliciously altering my comment, by repeatedly moving my reply from Thamster to yourself and forcefully changing its context/target. It's the reddit equivalent of an admin cutting out a comment from a specific chain and pasting it under a different one. Or a mailman scrubbing off the house number on an envelope and scribbling down his own. You are literally, objectively, in the wrong here. 
:''"I've made the reasons for the identation on the file talk page quite clear."'' '''You absolutely have not''', other than commenting ''"Each comment is indented by one"'', which I have already explained to be completely false. Please elaborate. Neither [[Template:Talkheader]] nor [[Help:Editing]] cover separate use of indentation, and every single Wikitext based webpage that I have ever interacted with, supports my use. As do the sources I linked. Correct use of indentation targeted towards specific replies is found everywhere on this wiki, such as on ''Admin_noticeboard/Archive_Feb_2021: Getting bombed by spam, Error in CSS, Talk:Crops#Comparison table, Talk:Elliott#Dialogue, Talk:Farming, Talk:Mushroom Tree, Talk:Qi Fruit, Talk:Stardew Valley Wiki#Ginger Island, Stardew Valley Wiki:Admin noticeboard, User talk:Margotbean/Archive 2021 Feb - Dec (Improving the state of the wiki, You are abusing your admin's right, Xbox multiplayer: pausing time, User talk:Margotbean Standardize hotfix format in version history, Drink Ginger ale?'', to name a few. There is literally zero reason to waste your, or my time on this nonsense. You should just refrain from further altering my correct use of comments. It's simply maladministration, a seemingly unshakable habit of yours. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 11:22, 30 May 2022 (UTC)
::This is not wikipedia, and wikipedia rules may or may not apply. In this case, the admin made a decision about the format of the page. It's fine to disagree, but repeated snide comments and outright hostility are wholly unacceptable. Please consider this your final opportunity to stop the negative comments, in particular those directed at this admin. Your positive contributions are not outweighed by abuse of wiki staff. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:28, 30 May 2022 (UTC)
::: We are done communicating about this. Feel free to continue correcting any mistakes I accidentally make in the future, it's appreciated. In this case, me replying to THamster is not a mistake, it's intentional and adheres to all rules and common formatting guidelines, to a T. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 04:52, 31 May 2022 (UTC)
:::: Hey Dubesor, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding and unhappiness related to the disagreement here. I looked over things and I endorse Margotbean's efforts to maintain the wiki and standardize its structure. That being said, please feel free to contact me directly cole.medeiros [at] stardewvalley [dot] net if you have any trouble that I can help you with. I appreciate the time you've put into the game and your willingness to share what you've learned with the folks on the wiki. Please be as respectful as possible towards admins, as it really helps to lighten the load of maintaining and managing this resource. Thank you again! --[[User:ColitoCole|ColitoCole]] ([[User talk:ColitoCole|talk]]) 17:21, 31 May 2022 (UTC)
::::: Thanks for the contact, Cole. I too endorse Margotbean's efforts to maintain the wiki and standardize its structure. Altering my comment however is no such case. Indentation structure is consistent with my (correct) use everywhere on this wiki, as pointed out in my last reply. I have also written you an email shortly after your message. Much appreciated [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 04:14, 2 June 2022 (UTC)

:::::: To Margotbean: 
:::::: You are an excellent editor and admin in the most time. But banning an active contributor for 3 months for ''"Each comment is indented by one"'' is ridiculous. If you think it's neccessary to make each comment indented or the wiki will be destoryed, please prove that you're right with discussion and then add it to the wiki policy to avoid the catastrophe. [[Help:Editing#Talk pages|''Edit warring (repeatedly overriding or reimplementing contributions) is highly discouraged.'']]. You started the edit war first and then you only banned Dubesor. Is it an abuse of rights? 
:::::: ''"You've made your dislike for me well known"''. Did you mean [[User_talk:Margotbean/Archive_2021_Feb_-_Dec#You_are_abusing_your_admin.27s_right|this reply]]? Then I have to doubt that banning Dubesor for 3 months for this little thing is an avenge.
:::::: ''"wikipedia rules may or may not apply"'', then what is applied? And what is not applied? Or it is only determined by your mood? Please write in the wiki policy that ''"Admin is always right. Don't disobey them, or you will be banned even if you have made thousands of edits"'' to avoid similar situation happening in the future again if you don't think it's a little authoritarian. This is not your own wiki, we learn from it and we contribute to it, it belongs to our all stardew valley players.

:::::: To Dubesor:
:::::: I'm stand with you. Thanks for your work for all players. Don't care about it and have a nice day!

:::::: To ColitoCole:
:::::: We need a fair judgement which is only related to the problem and the ban itself. Is it right to ban an active contributor who has made thousands of editors? If you think it's right, is it properly to ban him for 3 months for such little thing? Besides, I think that we need another active admin to cooperate with Margotbean to relieve his work and make important decisions together. Thanks!

:::::: --&lt;small>[[User:Horizon98|Horizon98]] ([[User talk:Horizon98|Discussion]])&lt;/small> 08:50, 3 June 2022 (UTC)

:::::: I have received Cole's reply this morning. Thank you, Cole! Hope it will be handled properly soon. --&lt;small>[[User:Horizon98|Horizon98]] ([[User talk:Horizon98|Discussion]])&lt;/small> 03:00, 4 June 2022 (UTC)
