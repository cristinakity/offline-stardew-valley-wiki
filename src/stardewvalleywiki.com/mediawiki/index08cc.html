==Warp Totem==
idk how to format this.
22:07 MST, 3/3/2021
i found a beach warp totem from an artifact spot, 27-28th of winter, year two, northeast of pierre's 
page says nothing about totems
any info?
:With v1.5, there is a 0.001% for a Warp Totem (Farm, Mountains, or Beach) to replace Clay, starting in Summer of year 1.  (Reference: &lt;samp>StardewValley.GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp>) [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:33, 5 March 2021 (UTC)
::I haven't really been paying close attention, but it seems like I've gotten several Warp Totems from Artifact Spots in 1.5. I was assuming it was in addition to Clay, since Bone Fragments and Clay come at the same time, but I'm not sure that that's the case. Are you sure it's not 0.1%? That would more closely align with my experience.
::As for Bone Fragments, I'm sure I've seen those in places other than Ginger Island. I'm trying to remember if I've seen them in places other than The Beach and The Desert, but I remember seeing them in those two places at least. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 22:26, 5 March 2021 (UTC)
:::Is the chance of finding a warp totem also tied to whether the player is eligible to/has found all secret notes? Confused by the "else if" statement - seems like it has a potential to replace clay only after the secret note conditions have been checked.
:::I did take a stab at updating for the likelihood of Qi Beans, and a quick note about the new archaeologist/generous enchantments. I'm happy to post the decompiled &lt;samp>StardewValley.GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp> statement here if people want to take a look at the updates, but I don't want to violate any kind of terms! 
:::Also, it does look like Bone Fragments can drop on the mainland too, so that should be added if someone can parse the likelihood (looks like it has to do with Gunther's special quest). [[User:Efarn|Efarn]] ([[User talk:Efarn|talk]]) 02:23, 9 March 2021 (UTC)
::::I found 4 Bone Fragments in an Artifact Spot at the Bus Stop, so it's possible to get them on the Mainland. But: Gunther's special Order Quest "Fragments of the past" was already completed when I found them (That's why I took another Fragment from a chest and put them into the Bone Mill to get '''20 Quality Fertilizer''' (double Item, 0.003% Chance!?^^)). [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:07, 15 April 2021 (UTC)
::::Edit: 0,001, not 0,003 Chance^^ [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:09, 15 April 2021 (UTC)

== Enchantments ==

I added quick notes about the tool enchantments added in 1.5 that affect items received from artifact spots. However, the &lt;samp>StardewValley.GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp> code implies that the Generous enchant doesn't affected certain drops. I can't read the code well enough to know whether I'm correct; just adding a note in case anyone dives farther into the code and wants to clarify. [[User:Efarn|Efarn]] ([[User talk:Efarn|talk]]) 02:42, 9 March 2021 (UTC)

==Ginger Island==
I've added the artifacts that can be found exclusively on Ginger Island, but the percentages could use a double-check.  The game code executes for the specific island location first, then the general "IslandLocation" function, and then runs the general "digUpArtifactSpot" code that checks &lt;samp>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/samp> first and &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp> afterward.  In short, it's complicated.  Anyone with a specialty in probabilities that wants to take a stab at double-checking them, ''please'' feel free to do so!  Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:27, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
:I had a quick look at the location numbers (not the global ones) and here is what I noticed: 1) Island North requires bridge to be fixed and mining level only increases fragments by up to 1, the other one comes from luck. 2) Island South needs cave to be open. 3) Island West needs cave to be open and snake skull is 10%, not 25%. 4) Anywhere has a special condition whether a golden coconut has been cracked or not. taro tuber and artifact are "else if" statements so the probability decreases, e.g. 15% artifact trove only after it failed the coconut check and also only after it did not receive tuber. So troves should be 10.05%, I think? [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 20:54, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
:edit: I just saw the Island West has &lt;code>return;&lt;/code> skips, meaning you can't get vertebrae if you get the skull, so the actual chance of Snake Vertebrae should be 22.5% (25% of 90%). Island North same thing: 22.5% for fragments. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 22:40, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
::Well, opening the cave means you've unlocked the Island Field Office, I thought that was obvious, but I think it could use a mention.  The golden coconut is in the game code, but also in &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp>, so I put ">10%", if you haven't cracked one at the Blacksmith, you can still get one in an artifact spot that way.  I don't know which bridge needs to be repaired; I think it's the bridge to the dig site, which is where the artifact spots spawn, so I don't know if that needs to be specified...
::As for the percentages, I simply don't know if it's that simple or not!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:52, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
::: Well, some of the current numbers are 100% false since I tested it by running the code in dotnetfiddle (you can easily test thousands of outcomes this way) or you can test examples e.g. by setting snake skull chance to 100% and then you can see that snake vertebrae will never happen. Normally when there are multiple "if" statements they will be evaluated in order, however since "return;" statement was used inside the if block then additional blocks will not be tested if the former if block triggered. essentially a positive "if+return;" is the same as using a failed "else if" check. Ergo vertebrae has a 25% chance only if the 10% chance for snake skull did not happen. So it's 0.25 x (1.0 - 0.1) instead of 0.25 x 1.0. As for the golden coconut you have it backwards: &lt;code>Game1.netWorldState.Value.GoldenCoconutCracked.Value&lt;/code> means you have already cracked a coconut - not that you haven't cracked one yet, (see GeodeMenu.cs line 141 for reference where it tests for "&amp;&amp; !Game1.netWorldState.Value.GoldenCoconutCracked.Value" (&amp; NOT GoldenCoconutCracked) for receiving the golden walnut on 1st crack. Also I just found (Golden Coconut (1) +Mixed Seeds (1)) on an Island Southeast artifact spot in my 100% perfection file. I will correct the numbers that I am 100% sure of, the global ones might need further revision because you are right in that the general ones are a bit more complicated. Anyway I hope I explained it well if not testing the code segments on dotnetfiddle is a great way to test the outcomes of the given code! [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 14:35, 18 April 2021 (UTC)
::::Hello from 2 years later -- I'm also confused, because I frequently receive 3 (!) omni geodes from ginger island artifact spots when the wiki says it should only be 1. I thought it may be due to my gemologist/excavator profession but a different player without that profession got the same x3 drop. I can't find anything in the code that even specifies object 749 (omni geode) as a drop from tilling (just mining omni nodes, beach supply crates, panning, monsters, shop stock)... something is definitely fishy.[[User:Cooperka|Cooperka]] ([[User talk:Cooperka|talk]]) 02:25, 12 April 2023 (UTC)

== Finding artifact spots with Tracker profession ==

[[Artifact_Spot#Notes|§ Notes]] says the Tracker profession "can make it easier to find artifact spots". This is, at the very least, not true on the Android smartphone port. (I think that version the equivalent of PC version 1.4.5, but "?" and then lower left shows no version.) Arrows point to wild resources, but not artifact spots. Apparently finding artifact spots this way was added somewhere along the way, although I cannot find the change in the [[Version History]]. --[[User:Norbert|Norbert]] ([[User talk:Norbert|talk]]) 13:15, 20 February 2022 (UTC)
:I was able to test this on PC with v1.3.36, and the Tracker profession showed arrows for artifact spots in that version. So, the mobile version should be working the same. I would suggest you consult the official forums to see if there is a bug report and/or fix for the problem in a thread there (https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/). Best of luck, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:02, 20 February 2022 (UTC)

==1.6==
v 1.6 spots. Some spots appear which look different from the old ones, having a green wavy stem instead of the brown orthogonal ones. The new ones have the new seeds and books beneath them. How can we differentiate between the two in the wiki? Should there be a new page, and what should the new ones be called? [[User:Altair0|Altair0]] ([[User talk:Altair0|talk]]) 23:50, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
:[[Seed Spot]] seems like a good idea. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 01:57, 24 March 2024 (UTC)

== 1.6 update ==

I have put in some of the missing things from the 1.6 update, and updated the Ginger Island section based upon the code being refactored with most items moved to Locations.xnb instead of overriding functions.
I also tried to update some wording to indicate you can get multiple items.
I'm not sure if the main section should also be updated due to this refactor.
With the code in its current state, it checks for Mystery Boxes, then rare items (animal crackers, cosmetics and a skill book), before then going through things found in locations.xnb.
Now, contrary to what the lost book ref says, it is the first thing checked, then artifacts, then snow yams, winter roots, Qi Beans, rice shoots, bone fragments, then the location specific items, then secret notes, warm totems and finally clay.
I'm not sure how much chances are impacted, and if they have changed at all, as there are a lot of numbers, which vary between different locations and conditions.[[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 09:52, 23 June 2024 (UTC)
:Thank you for looking into all that! We can add a stub template to any sections where the percents might have changed. I think the code changes are a ''lot'' to look at, and it took about 5 years before anyone got the percentages correct in the first place, so don't feel that it has to be resolved quickly! 
:There is also v1.6.9 coming, and it might (maybe, maybe not) involve a complete refactor of the game code. So updating references for v1.6.8 may be wasted work. I do appreciate your dedication to making the wiki accurate for artifact spots!! If you put it on the back burner, so to speak, and come back to it when you want to do a project, that would be incredible too! If not, your work is appreciated. Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:33, 23 June 2024 (UTC)
::I had a quick look based on the current code. And threw it all in a giant Excel Spreadsheet. I think I have all the chances correct. Rather than add it all to the main page, I thought I would create a separate one here [[Artifact_Spot/Chances]], at least until 1.6.9 comes out. Looking at it, it appears the chances don't all match, so I updated the stub note at the top of the page (I think all the 1.6 drops are already added.)[[User:JackBlack69|JackBlack69]] ([[User talk:JackBlack69|talk]]) 11:47, 24 June 2024 (UTC)
