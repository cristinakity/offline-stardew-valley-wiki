==Some missing things==
I'm bringing over some open discussion from the CF wiki, and noting a few other things:
* &lt;s>The [[Desert Trader]] is missing from [[The Desert|the Desert]] section. (Margot is aware of this, just posting again so there's a record of the request here).&lt;/s>
* &lt;s>The [[Mobile_Version_History#iOS|current iOS version]] is 1.4.5.153 and can be updated on the main page to reflect that.&lt;/s>
* &lt;s>The current link out to the PS4 store page for Stardew Valley is broken, and can be updated to https://www.playstation.com/games/stardew-valley/. This link appears twice, as part of the PS4 button and in the version history list.&lt;/s>
* The CF wiki had a line that read &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>A player maintained resource which anyone can edit!  To get started, see [[Help:Editing]].&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code> This could be re-added before the line about how many articles the wiki has.
* &lt;s>Before the wiki transfer, the CF wiki was using season images on the main page, which could be set on this wiki now.&lt;/s>
I believe that's everything for this page, but I may think of other things later. - [[User:Odin|Odin]] ([[User talk:Odin|talk]]) 17:53, 18 February 2021 (UTC)
:I've struck out the things listed above that have been completed, since some were resolved via discussion on other talk pages. - [[User:Odin|Odin]] ([[User talk:Odin|talk]]) 04:29, 15 March 2021 (UTC)

::According to the version history page, the current computer version is 1.6.2, released on 21 March 2024. The main page can be updated to reflect that. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 16:53, 21 March 2024 (UTC)

==Ginger Island==
The [[The Desert|Desert]] currently has a link on this page, so wouldn't it make sense if [[Ginger Island]] did also? [[User:PointlessSerpent|PointlessSerpent]] ([[User talk:PointlessSerpent|talk]]) 19:17, 18 February 2021 (UTC)
:Well, technically, it's not this page but the Mainmenu template that needs to be updated. The menu has gotten a little unbalanced, so I suggest the following layout.
:* First group: Basics, The Farm, Environment, Gameplay
:* Second group: Items split over all four columns.
:* Third group: Locations split over all four columns. The first three columns would still be called The Valley; the fourth column would contain The Desert and Ginger Island and be called Other Locations or something, since they're not actually in Stardew Valley proper.
:The pages are edit-protected for good reason, but I could mock something up if TPTB are interested. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 06:54, 19 February 2021 (UTC)
::A mockup would definitely help.  Keep in mind that all 12 languages would need to be changed, so it would have to wait until other more pressing bugs are fixed!  But even-ing it out is a great idea, if all columns are the same length that would be a bonus.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:43, 21 February 2021 (UTC)
::: More pressing bugs? Are there some present issues with templates, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]]? [[User:RetroEdit|RetroEdit]] ([[User talk:RetroEdit|talk]]) 23:28, 22 February 2021 (UTC)

May I suggest that it might be time to re-examine this idea? I've been wanting a Ginger Island link on the home page for quite a while, so I can only suppose others might as well. Not sure I'm able to help implement, but I have been pondering where a link might go, since none seems to fit perfectly at present. If a page redesign is contemplated, here's an idea related to the discussion above: instead of Other Locations, perhaps Desert and Ginger Island might reside in a category called "Valley Neighborhood". I know of no actual game terminology that would fit, but the game has been radically expanded since its first release, so "Stardew Valley" really isn't as all-inclusive as heretofore, or else sub-categories need tags as well. Something like this seems the least disruptive mechanism. There's already had to be distinction among Pelican Town, Cindersap Forest, the Mountain, the Quarry, and the Railroad. I've never been able to decide entirely if the beach is part of the town, either, though some parts of game play treat it as such. (But it does have its own map.) [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 18:01, 17 January 2022 (UTC)
:Yep, I revisited it in the last topic on this page -- I think it would be good to wait until v1.5 is released on mobile before adding links to the main page, but it is something I want to see happen. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:10, 17 January 2022 (UTC)
::Sounds reasonable. The platform version gap certainly has its discomforts for everybody. I tend to forget that, not being subject to it myself. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 00:33, 20 January 2022 (UTC)

:::Hey, whenever the 1.5 update does release for mobile, I'd like to be of some help when the main page gets updated. I could mostly be a translator, being fluent in French, and I understand how quite a few other languages phrase things, so the words would be in their proper order, unlike google translate might give it to you. [[User:PrismaticGlasses|PrismaticGlasses]] ([[User talk:PrismaticGlasses|talk]]) 15:16, 22 June 2022 (UTC)
::::Well, thanks! I think the main page changes will consist of adding links to pages that are already created, so there will be existing translations already. But any other translation work you'd like to do would be appreciated! Just be sure to stick to in-game names of items where possible. Best wishes, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:23, 22 June 2022 (UTC)

== My ginger island is glitched ==

Every time I go around the area to the volcano, that whole area it’s all blue and I don’t know how to fix it. [[User:BrittanyShaye|BrittanyShaye]] ([[User talk:BrittanyShaye|talk]]) 19:47, 20 February 2021 (UTC)
:This is a known bug on consoles, and should be fixed soon.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:41, 21 February 2021 (UTC)

== New 1.5 update for IOS? ==

Has anyone heard anything of the big update for IOS?
:The update is in the works for mobile, but no release date yet. You can follow https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/ to know when it's available (or check his twitter feed right from the main page of the wiki). I do want to mention that talk/discussion pages are for discussing that wiki page, so while there's not really a place on the wiki to discuss the game more generally, you can do that on [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/ the forums], [https://discord.gg/stardewvalley the discord server], or [https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/ the subreddit]. All are great places to talk about the game or ask questions. - [[User:Odin|Odin]] ([[User talk:Odin|talk]]) 00:00, 23 February 2021 (UTC)

== Old talk pages ==

:The stardewcommunity wiki has/had many talk pages, should they be copied over in some way or disregarded? [[User:Gogbog|Gogbog]] ([[User talk:Gogbog|talk]]) 10:19, 25 February 2021 (UTC)
::If there's recent discussion on those talk pages that's still relevant, you could certainly bring that over to continue discussion, but I don't think anything that's older or has already been discussed needs to be. - [[User:Odin|Odin]] ([[User talk:Odin|talk]]) 17:07, 25 February 2021 (UTC)

==Image Swap==
I think we should change the images for the friendship and marriage links in the gameplay section. My thoughts are to put the heart for friendship and an image of the mermaid's pendant for marriage. [[User:PrismaticGlasses|PrismaticGlasses]] ([[User talk:PrismaticGlasses|talk]]) 22:41, 20 May 2021 (UTC)

== Vincent dialogue ==

So apparently I found a new Vincent dialogue. (I checked on his wiki page to make sure) Both he and I were on the beach on he first of summer year 2. I decided to talk to him. He said this: "I'm glad Dad's back... but he's different than I remember..." I'm not sure if this is specific to this time of the year or if he says this at different times as well. Also it might have to do with heart relationship levels with Vincent because I currently at the moment have a 4 heart relationship with him. All's I know is that its unique and not on his wiki page. If anyone can find out more details about this then we can decide on where it should go on the wiki page. For now though, we all can review this. (Yes I made a Stardew Valley Wiki account just for this and maybe something else in the future idk) [[User:Stardew Gamer|Stardew Gamer]] ([[User talk:Stardew Gamer|talk]]) 18:09, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

Bruh I forgot to add a t on the second the. Just ignore the mistake I made. [[User:Stardew Gamer|Stardew Gamer]] ([[User talk:Stardew Gamer|talk]]) 18:11, 5 June 2021 (UTC)
:Hello StardewGamer, and welcome to the wiki!  That quote is actually not new, I found it in the data files for v1.4 and v1.5.  I've added it to [[Vincent]]'s page.  In the future, you can post questions or observations about Vincent on his specific talk page (it's ok to create a new talk page if it doesn't exist yet).  This page is really for issues/comments/questions about the main page of the wiki.  Again, welcome, and thanks for the addition to Vincent's quotes.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:22, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

::Oh ok. I wasn't aware of this because yes I am new to being a wiki user. (I have used the wiki here to look things up before. But I don't necessarily see that as being a user) So basically I have used the wiki before but not actually with an account. I will use the info you have provided me with in the future. [[User:Stardew Gamer|Stardew Gamer]] ([[User talk:Stardew Gamer|talk]]) 18:46, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

== User TAN0039 making mass deletion ==

I created an account just today because i noticed the user TAN0039 making a ton of mass article deletions and wasn't sure how best to bring attention to this, so I'm posting here about it. [[User:Crabwithaknife|Crabwithaknife]] ([[User talk:Crabwithaknife|talk]]) 23:13, 9 June 2021 (UTC)


== Is posting our hosted farm codes allowed? ==

I was making a hosted farm and I wanted to know if it was okay if I could post my farm code.

:There's a dedicated [https://discord.com/invite/stardewvalley discord server] for that, called "multiplayer-lfg" [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:03, 19 June 2021 (UTC)

== How do I contribute to the Stardew valley wiki? ==

I want to contribute to the stardew valley wiki but I don't know how to do it I wonder if someone who knows can tell me [[User:SharpClaw|SharpClaw]] ([[User talk:SharpClaw|talk]]) 08:20, 26 June 2021 (UTC)
:Hi, welcome to the wiki! You can read [[Help:Editing]] to learn how to make a contribution. There are some difference between this wiki and wikipedia, but they are both powered by mediawiki. So the guides from wikipedia are also useful. Have fun here! [[User:Horizon98|Horizon98]] ([[User talk:Horizon98|talk]]) 10:53, 26 June 2021 (UTC)
::Thanks [[User:SharpClaw|SharpClaw]] ([[User talk:SharpClaw|talk]]) 13:38, 26 June 2021 (UTC)

Hi! I've never contributed to a wiki before, so please let me know if I should put this question somewhere else, but how do I create a page? I thought that it would be cool to have a page on hairstyles and/or hats (like listing the different hairstyles and modeling them on a charactor so you can see them in the wiki). Looking through the editing page though, I'm guessing that probably counts as a major edit, so I guess the question would be, then, how long does it take before I could do that? [[User:StarlightIris|StarlightIris]] ([[User talk:StarlightIris|talk]]) 05:12, 26 May 2023 (UTC)
:Hello! Your project sounds like something more suited to post on reddit or the forums (links in the left sidebar). The wiki already has a page for every hat, and hairstyles can be previewed in-game. The sheer number of variations involved would be a major project, and remember that changes made in English have to be carried out in 11 other languages. So my best advice is to work on the project on your computer, and if you get close to covering all the variations, then make a post on reddit and check the response. Good luck to you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 05:54, 26 May 2023 (UTC)
::Thanks. That would make sense- I've never made a wiki page before, but I thought it would be neat to be able to preview hats on a model's hair just to see how they sit since different hats sit differently. Thanks for the advice! [[User:StarlightIris|StarlightIris]] ([[User talk:StarlightIris|talk]]) 16:24, 26 May 2023 (UTC)

I’m also not experienced with wiki editing- but I love Stardew valley, and I was wondering if it’s possible to make a page for the upcoming 1.6 items that have been put on twitter (e.g. Big Chest) with the descriptions and the information given- I don’t know if it’s a bad question/somewhere it says the answer, but I would love to help any way that I can! [[User:BreadIsOverrated|BreadIsOverrated]] ([[User talk:BreadIsOverrated|talk]]) 06:12, 30 December 2023 (UTC)
:Those items are already on the main page, in the right sidebar next to the menu. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 09:09, 30 December 2023 (UTC)

== Ginger Island ==

I was wondering if ginger Island should show up on the home page, as it is a important location.

== Winter Festival Year 6 ==

I have gotten to year 6 and the day of the winter festival and my 'special person' I give a gift to is Evelyn that year. I can get to the part of giving her a gift but once I do and the cut scene fades black the game freezes and then crashes and I cannot get past this day. Has anyone else has the same issue ? Or similar ones? Is my system just being finnikey or is there an actual bug in the game regarding this? [[User:NaamahSpeed|NaamahSpeed]] ([[User talk:NaamahSpeed|talk]]) 19:14, 19 February 2022 (UTC)

== Please help! Saved file empty when transferring to new device! ==

I’ve tried every possible method as listed here and on multiple sites for transferring my saved Stardew Valley game from my android to new iPhone. The file isn’t corrupted because it works just fine still on my old android phone. I have tried to copy the saved file and loading it to new device using:

1) phone to pc to phone
2) google cloud drive
3) iCloud
4) multiple file transfer sites
5) email

None of these work. I love my game and do not want a new one. Is there anyone who can review the file or who helps with this? I don’t understand why everyone else seems to be able to retrieve their files when using these same methods. Mine always ends up flat out empty when I try to load it.

== Fossil Tent Ginger Island ==

Hey!
My friend and I are attempting to complete the game but there was a glitch with the fossil tent. We donated all of the fossils and got the ostrich incubator.

I don't know if I like how it is set up, but the wiki's content background and sidebar are both transparent, which while isn't an issue for many, it does make it hard to see the text sometimes against the green hills.

I checked mediawiki documentation, but the most helpful page on the subject is probably here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:User_style although you will want to name it &lt;samp>User:PanchamBro/vector.css&lt;/samp> and skip the part about "Special pages".

== "A Complete Collection" missing/not appearing ==

Hey, so I've having issues with an item not appearing on the Artifact tab, but I resolved by finding another one of the missing item then it reappeared back on the tab. But now, I'm having problems with an Achievement star. I just finished completing my museum collection (minerals and artifacts), and I still haven't received my "A Complete Collection" achievement, and I'm kinda worried it might affect the rest of the end game grading or whatever. 

Please just reply if you have any tips on how to resolve this. Thank you! [[User:Laylalozada11|Laylalozada11]] ([[User talk:Laylalozada11|talk]]) 15:55, 25 June 2022 (UTC)

:Artifacts not showing up sometimes is a known bug. That said, I think you should probably double-check if you have actually donated everything you needed to for the museum. Even though there are a few bugs when it comes to showing up in the collections tab, as long as you have the item donated it will still count. (This happened in one of my save files where I had an empty slot on the collections tab due to the bug but still got the achievement).

== Ginger Island Additions ==

This might be asking a lot, but anyways. Is there a way Robin could build certain buildings on Ginger Island? Not asking for the whole list, but rather a few items like the pond, mill, shed, and maybe even a cabin upgrade. I think the material and cost should be a little more, considering she'd have to take the boat to the island and back, and would probably take a few more days. But just an idea to make Ginger Island a little more fun! Especially during the wintertime. [[User:Soby207|Soby207]] ([[User talk:Soby207|talk]]) 12:03, 28 June 2022

== Shut down temporary old wiki? ==

Chucklefish [https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-wiki-ownership-change/ transferred the wiki to ConcernedApe in February 2021]. They couldn't transfer some of the user content for legal reasons, so they kept a temporary readonly backup at [https://stardewcommunitywiki.com stardewcommunitywiki.com] just in case we needed anything that wasn't migrated. Unfortunately that's regularly causing confusion now (especially for new mod authors), since users land on the old wiki and see outdated info. For example, mods created with the old guides won't work in the latest versions of the game. Is it still useful to keep the old wiki around now, or should we ask ConcernedApe about shutting it down now? —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 03:55, 29 July 2022 (UTC)&lt;/small>

Right click it while standing within on square of it to descend to level 1 of the mines, and you're on your way. Uncover another ladder on level 1, it will get you to level 2, and so on. At level 5, the game will record your descent by five more levels and an elevator to this level is created, for future immediate descents. You can also ascend the elevator to any level that is a multiple of five that you have visited before. It rocks. It's a mine, after all.

== Spinners + Dressed Spinners actually reduce max bite time by 5/10 seconds, respectively ==

I was trying to compute some fishing odds, and I stumbled upon this piece of source code to understand max bite time (from Tools/FishingRod, on 1.5.6, should be the same on 1.6 except now you can equip 2 tackles.)

      float val2 = (float) Game1.random.Next(FishingRod.minFishingBiteTime, FishingRod.maxFishingBiteTime - 250 * who.FishingLevel - (this.attachments[1] == null || this.attachments[1].ParentSheetIndex != 686 ? (this.attachments[1] == null || this.attachments[1].ParentSheetIndex != 687 ? 0 : 10000) : 5000));
      if (isFirstCast)
        val2 *= 0.75f;
      //... rest of code...

This means that the Spinner, and Dressed spinner reduce the max fishing time by 5000ms (5s) or 10000ms (10s), respectively. It's just that, on first cast, the max time is reduced by 25%, so its ''effective'' reduction is 3.75s/7.5s, but this doesn't apply if you miss the first nibble, and reverts back to 5/10s. This isn't consistent with how we explain fishing level decreases, as we say it reduces by .25s per level, but by the same logic it's actually reducing it by  .1875s per level '''only if it's the first nibble'''. This also needs to take into account baits, which can apply another multiplicative decrease of .5 up to .67

Should we update this across the board and also mention how spinners affect bite time on the Fishing page? [[User:Surg|Surg]] ([[User talk:Surg|talk]]) 22:15, 10 May 2024 (UTC)

:When we explain Fishing level decreases, we ''later'' explain that the time is reduced by 25% if it was the first cast, so there is no inconsistency. We use isFirstCast for Spinners and Dressed Spinners because, well, 99% of the time players are ''not'' going to miss the first cast. If you want to, you can make a disclaimer on the Spinner and Dressed Spinner pages about this. The past wiki editors didn't find it useful though, based on [[Talk:Tackle#Tackle Behavior|this discussion]]. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 02:02, 11 May 2024 (UTC)
