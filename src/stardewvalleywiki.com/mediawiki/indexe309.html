For now, we should use this talk page as a place to store test information. No one really know what varieties of "Green Rain Trees" there are, how and where they appear, what they yield when tapped, and more.

==Unification==

*Mossy Seeds
**These can be obtained outside of green rain events but seem to have a higher drop rate during Green Rain events

*On "Wild Trees"
**Tree Fertilizer's description mentions "wild trees", and works on trees except fruit trees.
**Mushroom Log's output is boosted by nearby Oak / Maple / Pine trees, supporting that these trees are considered "Wild Trees."
**It makes less sense, then, to refer to "Mossy Trees" as "Wild Trees" because "Wild Tree" could also refer to Oak / Maple etc.

*It has been found, in multiple cases, that random trees on a farm have been spontaneously converted to random varieties of Green Rain Trees—even whilst growing. We need to look into this ASAP, as this is concerning a lot of people and no one knows why... :) [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 07:20, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

--[[User:Darkstreamfarm|Darkstreamfarm]] ([[User talk:Darkstreamfarm|talk]]) 02:32, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

:Interesting findings and great work. I see your point about renaming the current '''Wild Tree''' and '''Lush Wild Tree''' to something else, but I'm not sure if [[Mossy Tree]] might be the best name, since they don't have anything specific to [[Moss]] that the other 'normal' trees like Oak don't have. [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 07:57, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

In game code, they were called greenRainTreeBushy, greenRainTreeLeafy, greenRainTreeFern, respectively. See &lt;samp>TerrainFeatures::Tree&lt;/samp>.

When &lt;code>onGreenRainDay&lt;/code> if the following conditions is met:&lt;code>if ((treeType == "1" || treeType == "2") &amp;&amp; (int)growthStage >= 5 &amp;&amp; Game1.random.NextBool(0.75))&lt;/code>:
* Which means when the green rain happens, every fully grown oak or maple tree over the valley has a possibility (~75%) to turn into TemporaryGreenRainTree.
* [[Oak Tree]] would turn into greenRainTreeBushy;
* [[Maple Tree]] would turn into greenRainTreeLeafy.
* Generally, they would turn back into what they were the next day.

When &lt;code>seasonUpdate&lt;/code> if the following conditions is met:&lt;code>(Game1.IsFall &amp;&amp; Game1.random.NextDouble() &lt; 0.05 &amp;&amp; !tapped &amp;&amp; (treeType.Value == "1" || treeType.Value == "2") &amp;&amp; Location != null &amp;&amp; !(Location is Town) &amp;&amp; !Location.IsGreenhouse)&lt;/code>:
* Which means when the season change into Fall (Summer 28 → Fall 1), every oak or maple tree '''without tapped''' has a possibility (~5%) to turn into TemporaryGreenRainTree. This transformation would NOT happen to those trees on the town or in the greenhouse.
* [[Oak Tree]] would turn into greenRainTreeBushy;
* [[Maple Tree]] would turn into greenRainTreeLeafy.
* Generally, they would turn back into what they were when the next Spring comes.
* There seems to be a bug, in which trees with [[Heavy Tapper]] is not counting as tapped. They could turn into greenRainTree while Heavy Tappers remains on them.
* My point is that it's really a reuse of sprites. In terms of gameplay and contextual setting, these types of trees don't really have much to do with Green Rain. It's more of a way to show a process of trees dying in autumn and recovering in spring.
[[User:Ethan|Ethan]] ([[User talk:Ethan|talk]]) 09:16, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

:Because of this, maybe we should rename Wild Tree as Bushy Wild Tree or Bushy Tree and Lush Wild Tree as Leafy Wild Tree or Leafy Tree. Maybe the latter ones? I think that way it leans into the idea of trees' leaves falling in the fall and reviving in spring, rather than them being completely different trees.

==Incorrect images==
I think the first fully grown stage picture of the new green trees is wrong, when I check the raw data (and check in-game) they aren't moss covered usually. See https://imgur.com/hBU1HIH
:i agree. The images of those two wild trees here use their moss version. same goes for the second tree's stump. [[User:Sooji gooji|Sooji gooji]] ([[User talk:Sooji gooji|talk]]) 15:30, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
::I figured it to be best to use the moss variants, and mention that they can also appear without moss. It would be sort of confusing to include both those variants within one page. I do, however, agree that those stumps should be changed to their non-mossy variants. [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 17:19, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

==Naming==	
Due to the number of edits to my talk page, it's clear that there is no consensus on the names of these trees. IMO, all relevant pages should redirect to "Green Rain Trees", and they can be named "Green Rain Tree 1", "Green Rain Tree 2" and "Green Rain Tree 3". In any case, "Mossy Tree" is not an option, because it will be confused with any tree that has moss on it. "Fiddlehead Stalk" is a fine name, but without better names for the other two, what good is it? [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:21, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
:See the above. I think Bushy Tree and Leafy Tree could work. I do agree, though. We need to have good, reasonable names. I don't however, think that numbering them like that is the best option; we should come up with something. Seeing that the came code uses the aforementioned, it might be our best bet. [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 17:26, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
::I don't think, however, that they should redirect back to [[Green Rain Trees]]. This is because there are specific attributes about each tree. The fiddlehead stalk and its tapping, and the other two's correlation with oak and maple trees. [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 17:32, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
:::If 'Bushy' and 'Leafy' are how they're named inside the code then those seem like reasonable (and future-proof) names. [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 17:46, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
::::Ok, if we do come to a consensus on this, then I want to be clear about which ones turn into which ones. "Wild Tree" > "Bushy Tree" '''and''' "Lush Wild Tree" > "Leafy Tree."
:::::Have you played through the green rain event in Summer and played through Fall? You may have a surprise then. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:48, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
:::::Also, please stop creating redlinks, please please please. You can boldface and use quotes instead. Thanks in advance! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:49, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
::::::What is this surprise? I've played through the green rain event but not yet through fall. Also, sorry about the redlinks. I'll try to do better. :) [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 18:51, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
:::::::Depending on what this "surprise" is, and as long as it doesn't affect these names, it may be best to move the pages as soon as we can to prevent further confusion for users. We can figure out all these technical details afterwards. [[User:Brandon Echols|Brandon Echols]] ([[User talk:Brandon Echols|talk]]) 20:26, 27 March 2024 (UTC)
:Most users aren't looking things up based on what it says in the game code. In-game, these trees are referred to as "wild trees" (in the description of the [[Mossy Seed]] and [[Mushroom Log]]. At the very least, Wild Tree should be a redirect. [[User:SV Ludicer|SV Ludicer]] ([[User talk:SV Ludicer|talk]]) 15:51, 2 April 2024 (UTC)
::Not sure if these references you make are entirely true, for [[Mushroom Log]] the wild trees it refers to are any kind of wild trees (e.g. oak and maple as well), and for [[Mossy Seed]] its '''''rare''' wild trees''. Not sure how to solve this naming issue though :s [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 16:34, 2 April 2024 (UTC)
