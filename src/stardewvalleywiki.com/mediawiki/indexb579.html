== Fish Disappearing ==

I threw 5 Sturgeon into a pond that was just build, or I thought I did anyway.  I walked up to the pond and opened my inventory by hitting Esc.  Then I grabbed the sturgeon and clicked off the inventory.  All of them disappeared into the pond with a splash but then they were gone.  So much wasted fishing time. [[User:Ekztal|Ekztal]] ([[User talk:Ekztal|talk]]) 15:44, 27 June 2021 (UTC)
:You can only hold the sturgeon on your hand (instead of opening inventory) and then right click the fish pond to throw them into the pond. What you did was throwing them out of your inventory, but you were near water at that time. It equals to throwing them into the river/sea instead of the fish pond. This is why you heard the splash but the fishes were gone. Besides, the initial capacity of a fish pond for rare fishes (like sturgeon) is only one fish. [[User:Horizon98|Horizon98]] ([[User talk:Horizon98|talk]]) 16:50, 27 June 2021 (UTC)
::I will update the page to be more clear about what "holding the fish" means. So sorry that happened to you. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:58, 27 June 2021 (UTC)

== Fish pond full reproduction ==

I found that if a fish pind has reached its max population and spent a period in which it was able to reproduce once while it was was full (10 fishs). Then if one or more fishs are removed than the fish pond will immediately reproduce next day. [[User:Void farmer|Void farmer]] ([[User talk:Void farmer|talk]]) 20:41, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
:Yes, that's true. Also, if you fill a fish pond to its current max capacity with caught fish, you still have to wait the full number of days it would take the pond to produce them. These might be interesting trivia points to add to the page. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:20, 10 October 2023 (UTC)

== Add icons within the tables ==

Hello there. I see that there have been '''recurring attempts to add icons to the tables (six in total)''', including ones using the &lt;nowiki>{{name}}&lt;/nowiki> template, '''each time reversed by the admin [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]]'''. 

However, no proper discussion have been ever opened in this very page, even if it would have made easier to follow the debate on the subject, instead of disseminating it on various talk pages.

So for the future, I'm pointing out the '''two last discussions''' I know about:
* [[User_talk:Charly#Fish_Pond|November 2021 on Charly's user page]]
* [[User_talk:Margotbean#Fish_Ponds_.7B.7Bname.7D.7D_template_changes|January 2023 on Margotbean's user page]]

To sum things up, there are '''two main arguments I've read''' preventing the use of the &lt;nowiki>{{name}}&lt;/nowiki> template, but I personally do not think they stand out if dealt with properly:

*'''First''', about the very opportunity of using &lt;nowiki>{{name}}&lt;/nowiki> template: '''does it increase or decrease readability?'''
:*'''Opponents:''' Margotbean seems to think it's not such an improvement ("''I think it makes certain sections of the table less readable''", [[User_talk:Margotbean#Fish_Ponds_.7B.7Bname.7D.7D_template_changes|I quote]]).
:*'''Proponents:''' I personally think that would be a big improvement and that the table is very uneasy to read without any icons. That was more or less the argument of Artoftheblue when proposing his change ("''I found that it's very difficult to search for the required fish otherwise''", [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Fish_Pond&amp;oldid=144626 I quote]). I think that the recurrence of spontaneous attempts pleads in the same direction. Incidentally, I've asked some other Stardew Valley players that I know personally what they thought about this, and they agreed on the idea that icons increase rather than decrease readability on this case. I've also came across the OldSchool Runescape Wiki (which is reputable on the internet) and noticed they make an [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Firemaking#Quests extensive use of icons].
:> If that's really an issue, I think it would be nice to have a vote of some sort to settle the question.

*'''Second''', in non-English language wikis, using the &lt;nowiki>{{name}}&lt;/nowiki> template breaks up the '''sorting''', as the English name is used to sort instead of the wiki-language name.
:> Nonetheless, this can be easily worked around by using the &lt;code>data-sort-value&lt;/code> cell property, ''e.g.'' &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>| data-sort-value="Fischlaich" | {{name|Roe}}&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code>.

I may miss some other arguments, but I think it would be nice to take those elements into account in the future, to avoid further attempts-reversions on this topic.

For the sake of the '''history''', here are the six previous attempts:

# [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Fish_Pond&amp;oldid=144645 3 January 2023 by Artoftheblue]
# [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Fish_Pond&amp;oldid=150504 25 September 2023 by Starfarmer]

There also have been attempts through the years in non-English language wikis ([https://de.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Fischteich&amp;oldid=18319 German], [https://es.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Estanque_de_peces&amp;oldid=18001 Spanish], [https://fr.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=%C3%89tang_%C3%A0_poissons&amp;oldid=3484 French], [https://ko.stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=%EB%AC%BC%EA%B3%A0%EA%B8%B0_%EC%97%B0%EB%AA%BB&amp;oldid=7633 Korean]).

I finally point out that the two tables with icons are also available on [[User:Artoftheblue/Fish_Pond|this user page]] by Artoftheblue.

Cheers,

-- [[User:Charly|Charly]] ([[User talk:Charly|talk]]) 07:28, 4 November 2023 (UTC)

: I would definitely support the change, and I agree with the view that it would greatly improve the page's readability. Frankly, it feels a little inappropriate to have improvements to the page, seemingly supported by most of the community, overruled by a single admin. -- [[User:Starfarmer|Starfarmer]] ([[User talk:Starfarmer|talk]]) 21:57, 20 December 2023 (UTC)
