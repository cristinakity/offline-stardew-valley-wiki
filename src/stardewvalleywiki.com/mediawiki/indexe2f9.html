<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prehistoric_Levels">Prehistoric Levels</span></h2>
<p>Are Prehistoric Levels more common in 1.5? The Wiki says the odds are 2.2%. Before the wiki was updated about a month ago, it said nothing about odds. I seem to remember seeing 1% somewhere, which is consistent with my experience with 1.4. I just got three prehistoric levels in a trip to Level 100 with staircases, so I was wondering if I got lucky or if the odds went up. Now I'm wondering, did the odds go up, or was I just unlucky before? There's nothing about it in the Version History. If it did change, it might be worth noting in the History section, but is there any evidence of it? <a href="../User_Zendowolf.html" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zendowolf.html" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 07:14, 5 June 2021 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rhubarb_Pie">Rhubarb Pie</span></h2>
<p>A monster just dropped a Rhubarb Pie when I killed it in the dangerous Skull Cavern (Skull Cavern Invasion quest active). It was either a Royal Serpent or a Giant Purple Slime (most likely a slime). This is not covered by the special items in <a href="../The_Mines.html#Special_Items" title="The Mines">The Mines#Special Items</a>, including the "random item from a treasure room". I've checked <samp>MineShaft::getTreasureRoomItem</samp>, and the possible cooked dishes have not changed. 
</p><p>I've received a lot of other seemingly strange drops, but they've all been explained by either Special Items or the Pink Cake inside the Giant Slime... this one I can't explain.
</p><p>Clearly there's more code-diving to be done on dangerous monster or dangerous Skull Cavern drops. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 01:00, 28 November 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>At the time I did not think so, since this is a recurring theme with me... I had cheats on so I was invincible, so I could concentrate on what was dropping what. Still, it doesn't make sense otherwise, so I have to conclude it was a crate or barrel.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Floor_layouts_and_themes">Floor layouts and themes</span></h2>
<p>Since <a href="../The_Mines.html" title="The Mines">The Mines</a> page says the layouts and themes for floors, would it make sense if the Skull Cavern page did also? because I feel a bit empty about it, for example, floors 33, 73, and 113 being a star shape. <a href="../User_9000.html" title="User:9000">9000</a> (<a href="../User_talk_9000.html" title="User talk:9000">talk</a>) 8:47, 25 July 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>The code would say otherwise.

So IBugOne is correct about this research.

<p>Since of the bug where placing a fence on floor 120 and blowing it up by a bomb created a ladder going to floor 1 of the Skull Caverns, so that means floor 1 of the Skull Caverns is floor 121 of <a href="../The_Mines.html" title="The Mines">The Mines</a>, while the wiki page says 2147483647 instead of 2147483527, feel free to check the game code for correction.

</p>
<dl><dd>You're right about this. The game code recognizes Skull Cavern floor <i>N</i> as Mines floor <i>N+120</i>, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the SC limit being 120 less than the integer limit. However, the page text says 2147483647 is the <i>integer</i> limit, which is correct per se. Also since this is only a "gotcha"-type of trivia, I'm not sure changing that reflects anything meaningful. - <a href="../User_IBugOne.html" title="User:IBugOne">IBugOne</a> (<a href="../User_talk_IBugOne.html" title="User talk:IBugOne">talk</a>) 15:15, 30 August 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>In the function to populate the levels (StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft.getMonsterForThisLevel, which in turn is called from StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft.populateLevel), has a few sections to generate a bat.</dd>
<dd>The first is for Dino floors, which result in an iridium bat, then there are the options for the mines, then for Skull Cavern, there are 2 options to generate a bat, with the conditions:</dd>
<dd>(this.mineLevel&#160;% 20 == 0 &amp;&amp; distanceFromLadder &gt; 10f) or (this.mineRandom.NextDouble() &lt; 0.33 &amp;&amp; distanceFromLadder &gt; 10f &amp;&amp; this.mineLevel &gt;= 171)</dd>
<dd>The first case matches the claimed behaviour of only seeing them on floors 20 and 40; and the latter case will produce an iridium bat.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, before either of these checks, it checks if it is loaded a DarkArea, in which case it will only spawn a ghost or a mummy.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>However, further down in the populateLevel function, it also checks (this.mustKillAllMonstersToAdvance() &amp;&amp; this.EnemyCount &lt;= 1), and adds a bat if true. But this doesn't specify the level so it should be a normal bat, not a lava bat.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>The only other location I can find it spawning a bat is in StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft.spawnFlyingMonsterOffScreen</dd>
<dd>In this case, for the Skull Cavern, it first checks (this.mineLevel &lt; 171 || Game1.random.NextDouble() &lt; 0.5) and if that is true it will spawn a serpent, if it is false it will spawn a bat.</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>So unless I am missing something, the only options for bat spawns are:
<ul><li>Normal bat spawning if you need to kill all the monsters to advance and no monster spawned.</li>
<li>Lava bat spawning on level 20 and 40 (given it is not a dark area).</li>
<li>Iridium bat spawning on level 51 and above, either on screen during the normal population event, or offscreen while still on the floor.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>So Lava bats should only spawn on level 20 and 40. I'll update the main page to say that.<a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 07:54, 3 January 2023 (UTC)

<h2><span id="Ore_distribution_bug?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Ore_distribution_bug.3F">Ore distribution bug?</span></h2>
<p>While looking at the code for ore distribution, I found the ore distribution for iron and copper to be quite strange.
The chance for iron is calculated as:
</p><p><code>chanceForIron = Math.Min(0.5, 0.1 + (double)(this.mineLevel - Math.Min(200, skullCavernMineLevel)) * 0.005)</code>
</p><p>But as mineLevel is always 120 more than skullCavernMineLevel, this can be rewritten as:
</p><p><code>chanceForIron = Math.Min(0.5, 0.7 + (double)(skullCavernMineLevel - Math.Min(200, skullCavernMineLevel)) * 0.005)</code>
</p><p>And as the minimum of skullcavernMineLevel and 200 cannot be larger than skullCavernMineLevel, this latter term will always be greater than 0, so this simplifies to:
</p><p><code>chanceForIron = 0.5</code>
</p><p>Practically this means iron and copper are equally rare. (And the check only occurs after passing an ore check and failing an iridium check and a gold check). But if this was intended, it makes much more sense to just use 0.5. This makes me think it is likely a bug, and that both were meant to use mineLevel (or both were meant to use skullCavernMineLevel) <a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 11:35, 18 April 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>This would be a good candidate to be reported as a bug on the official forums (link in left sidebar); there is a thread specifically for reporting bugs.

<dl><dd><samp>MineShaft::getTreasureRoomItem</samp> specifies 26 items that can be obtained; some items contain a range of values (like cooked dishes), so the 1/26 chance has to be multiplied by the number of items.

<p>Hi sorry I didn't know how to report this, but the table under the "Treasure Rooms" section that should display all possible treasures that can be randomly found inside Treasure Chests in the Skull Cavern, is not displaying. Not sure how to fix it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pre_historic_levels">Pre historic levels</span></h2>
<p>According to stardewvalley predictor the prehistoric levels have choosen persistent floors each days and can be re visited again however floor maps that are choosen randomly each time the player uses stairs or shafts to go next next floor can be eligible or not,changing the predictions to find them on those floors <a href="../User_Void_farmer.html" title="User:Void farmer">Void farmer</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Void_farmer.html?title=User_talk:Void_farmer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Void farmer (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:17, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>So basically they may or may not be persistent, from the player's point of view. I'll remove the statement, and please keep in mind that v1.6 is going to change a lot if things that are predictably random to be not predictable. MouseyPounds is not upddating the stardew predictor, so it may become obsolete. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:21, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>While I do agree that it remains to be seen if they will be fixed per day in 1.6, my understanding was that the main elements targeted were things like clay farming. After the update I will have a look at the code and see what it is like. If it does change in 1.6, it may be good to just have it as a note that prior to 1.6 each day only selected floors could be prehistoric floors. <a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>)

<p>New contributor so I don't know whether y'all happen to know this already, but at least fairy box (perhaps all trinkets) can be found from Treasure Rooms in Skull Cavern. Found one in a (non-dangerous) Skull Cavern run, so I just thought i'd mention since i didn't see it listed on this page or the pages for trinkets generally. <a href="../User_BeanieQueenE.html?title=User:BeanieQueenE&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:BeanieQueenE (page does not exist)">BeanieQueenE</a> (<a href="../User_talk_BeanieQueenE.html?title=User_talk:BeanieQueenE&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:BeanieQueenE (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:04, 25 March 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hey, new contributor here too. I also saw that trinkets were dropping from the treasure room chests an didn't see it on the wiki so took it upon myself to take a look. In the decompiled code you can see that all of the trinkets are able to drop IFF the player has the combat mastery unlocked (4.5% chance). Additionally, <a href="../Golden_Animal_Cracker.html" title="Golden Animal Cracker">Golden Animal Cracker</a>'s can drop if the player has the farming mastery unlocked. I updated the page earlier today. <a href="../User_Gruyere.html?title=User:Gruyere&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Gruyere (page does not exist)">Gruyere</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Gruyere.html?title=User_talk:Gruyere&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gruyere (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:22, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I have noticed that i get a LOT of golden spur from mummy level (i think from ghosts), and sometimes my dive will give me duplicates of one or two trinkets. wonder if there's anything to do with the monster slain, lvl i'm on, or just a random daily seed. <a href="../User_Jjiang31.html" title="User:Jjiang31">Jjiang31</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Jjiang31.html?title=User_talk:Jjiang31&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jjiang31 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:20, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
