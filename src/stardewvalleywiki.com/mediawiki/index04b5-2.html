==Unknown Item==
just loaded onto a very old cheat farm and found 'Cursed P.K. Arcade System'. i don't know what it is, there's nothing about it on this wiki
anyone have info?
-oxygen

:It is an item that exists in the game's data files, but was never actually implemented into the game. The only way to get it is through mods. There are a couple items like this that were never implemented. [[User:Squigs44|Squigs44]] ([[User talk:Squigs44|talk]]) 07:15, 7 February 2022 (UTC)

==Page Revamp==
I'm like to propose standardizing the Furniture page, particularly the wikitables. My suggestion is that each table (with a few exceptions such as "Night Market Paintings", "Movie Posters", "Seasonal Plants", etc) should have the following columns: "Carpenter's Shop", "Traveling Cart", "Furniture Catalogue", and "Other". The "Other" column would include the Oasis, the Casino, the Desert Trader, the Island Trader, Festivals, events, items unique to certain farms, etc. I think a standardization like that would remove the need for most of the information above each table, and it would help clear up some confusing listings. I'd also like to find a way to show all of the Wall Sconce options in the "Lamps &amp; Windows" section. I'm willing to tackle this myself over the next few weeks, but I'd like to open it up to discussion first. Thanks [[User:Digresser|Digresser]] ([[User talk:Digresser|talk]]) 03:06, 16 July 2023 (UTC)
:Hello Digresser! That sounds like a fine idea to reduce the number of columns in some tables. The fact that you said it would take "a few weeks" does concern me a bit... are you planning on updating all 12 languages? If so, that would be stupendous!!
:Why don't you create the changes in your user space (create a page called "&lt;nowiki>User:Digresser/FurnitureRedo&lt;/nowiki>" or somthing similar), and work on it there when you have time. That way, you can work out any problems or bugs before the changes go live, and you can also work at your leisure. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:06, 16 July 2023 (UTC)
::Sure, I can do it that way if you'd like. The reason I said "a few weeks" is because I don't have much time available to me, and I was planning on tackling one or two sections whenever I had an hour to spare. [[User:Digresser|Digresser]] ([[User talk:Digresser|talk]]) 03:50, 17 July 2023 (UTC)

== Furniture Template Update ==

I'd like to suggest 2 updates to furniture tables and the furniture article infobox template:
# '''Include furniture size''' (tile area, e.g., 2x3, 1x1; include for floor/tabletop ''and'' wall items)
# '''Include placement behavior''' (e.g., floor, wall, outside/inside, tabletop)

This information would be especially helpful for players who have yet to buy the furniture catalogue, as it will help them determine if they have the necessary/desired free space to place an individual item before purchasing it.

''Please note: I've only played Stardew Valley on mobile (iOS) so far, so am unsure if this information is included in purchase screens on other platforms. It is certainly missing in iOS, though.''

== Sitting on Chairs lets [[The Player]] enter a bedroom without having 2 or more hearts with a [[Villagers|Villager]] ==

In v1.5, a feature was implemented that lets [[The Player]] sit on Chairs, meaning you can find ways to exit the map, like you can use a Chair at the entrance of the [[Secret Woods]] when the [[Large Log]] was still there, without needing a [[Axes|Steel Axe]] or higher. But in [[Villagers|Villager]] bedrooms, if you have less than 2 hearts with a [[Villagers|Villager]], you cannot enter their bedroom, even if their door is open, but if the door is open but you don't have the 2 hearts needed, you can place a Chair in front of their door, then sit on the Chair, and then hop off the Chair, you can actually enter the bedroom, Meaning you don't need to have [[Friendship]] with [[Villagers]] to enter their bedroom. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:00, 26 January 2024 (UTC)
:And the poor souls who try it get stuck inside the bedroom and cannot leave. I don't know what the behavior is in version 1.6. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:42, 26 January 2024 (UTC)

::Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]], if [[The Player]] stands in a [[Villagers|Villager's]] way, the [[Villagers|Villager]] will stop moving, then in a few seconds they will get a "..." or a "?" bubble above their head, after this bubble goes, the [[Villagers|Villager]] will walk faster, unless you leave the area it happened, or entering a shop in [[Pelican Town|Town]], etc. If a [[Villagers|Villager]] walks through a [[Crafting|Crafted]] item, the [[Villagers|Villager]] will [[Crafting#Crafted goods outside of the farm|destroy]] the item. If the [[Villagers|Villager]] walks through a Chair, they will stop when touching it, they will get one of the bubbles above their head and walk faster, but the Chair will not be gone. They will just phase through Chairs without breaking them. Hope this helps! [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:27, 27 January 2024 (UTC)

== Link to All 1.6 New Items ==

Here is the link I found to all the new 1.6 Furniture, and every other new items. Please help this pages become up to date, as there are many new image files:
