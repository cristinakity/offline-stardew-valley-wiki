Tom Haws is a '''Wikipedia administrator''' for crying out loud (see his user page links). I'm not new to editing (non-fandom/gamepedia) wikis, and I find the admin behavior here poor. I see Margotbean disallowing things that appear to stem from a lack of MW knowledge. I see other's comments on this also, as well as missing wiki features that would invalidate the excuses. Excuses or not, there are ways to treat people that are respectful, and ways that aren't. Telling someone they can do something to turn around and reverse that very thing is not respectful. Being short on staff or time is not a valid excuse, the behavior is why the team doesn't expand. '''Thank you Cole, for at least confirming that the poor behavior appears to be condoned, because at least this lets people know not to waste their time. I'd ask that this section of the conversation is never archived please'''. </ins></div></td></tr>

Also, having a lack of proper policies and guidance is part of the problem (I see someone recently vandalized to this point, which I do '''not''' condone, but can certainly understand the impulse. Without robust policy documentation, Margotbean '''does''' make up the rules as she goes (to agree with the few lines I could read in the vandalism deletion summary--but stop please, vandalism is '''not''' the way to handle that). Margotbean also does not appear to treat all users the same. Further, bots are allowed on most wikis for a reason (you have no policy stating people can't, and anyone can edit via the MW API without you ever realizing they're using a bot, as long as it is well throttled). The ability to disable the edit API no longer exists in MW. The banned editor's ''real'' mistake was simply informing Margotbean of what she was ignorant to (she never would have known otherwise, if the user kept doing small throttled updates). Banning out of a lack of either knowledge or policies looks punitive, no matter how you slice it. The way things are done here is backwards (the Wikipedia Admin and other's spotted it quickly). Hopefully the other users who complained come back one day, if only to see they made the right choice. You have multiple different users here all saying similar things, which should tell you something. Conversation in private just allows the poor behavior to continue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Deletion_of_discussion_archives">Deletion of discussion archives</span></h2>
<p>Hi! You deleted <b>Stardew Valley Wiki:Admin noticeboard/Archives/2021-02</b> with a note that it's unneeded. The old wiki is temporary, so discussions that aren't archived to the new wiki will eventually be lost forever. What's the issue with archiving important discussion pages to avoid that? —<small><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Pathoschild" title="User talk:Pathoschild">talk</a>) 03:25, 20 February 2021 (UTC)</small>

<dl><dd>I was under the impression that the old wiki was not temporary.  If it's going away, then that changes things.

<dl><dd>I was told by Katzeus it "will be up for a while", so I think there will be plenty of time to archive stuff (people could even use archive.org to permanently save the old wiki), but it does sound like it's going to go down eventually.

I will personally make use of the admin noticeboard archive if a copy is kept on this site though. - <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:54, 22 February 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Hello Sev21!  On the English wiki, that info. is on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Controls" title="Controls">Controls</a> page (for PC), where the "Tab" key says "Shift toolbar", and at the bottom of the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a> page, the very last line, under "Tips".  You could elaborate a bit about what "shift toolbar" means (on the English wiki), and please feel free to update the Turkish pages.  You'll probably find that several (if not all) of the Turkish pages are out of date, since they were copied from English before version 1.5 (or before version 1.4 in some cases).  Go ahead and update, have at it!  And have fun!

<dl><dd>I'm not clear on how edits could be synced between different language versions: do 12 separate edits have to be made for each change to a template? That seems kind of annoying if that has to be done manually.</dd>
<dd>I understand the page move issue (though I would note the redirects would still preserve the interwiki links in both directions). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:RetroEdit&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:RetroEdit (page does not exist)">RetroEdit</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:RetroEdit" title="User talk:RetroEdit">talk</a>) 21:06, 24 February 2021 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Typos_in_item_description_that_cannot_be_edited_and_talk_pages_missing">Typos in item description that cannot be edited and talk pages missing</span></h2>
<p>Hello! I was trying to help a bit in some minor ways on the wiki and noticed two things: 1.) the contents of the talk pages from the old wiki seem to not have been copied/transferred. example I checked crab pots and luck pages on the old wiki and there are talk pages, on the new one there are none: which is unfortunate because I feel like the old talk pages hold valuable information.
Second: I noticed spelling errors that seem not to be editable: Artifacts:Ornamental Fan: <i>This exquisute fan</i> (misspelled exquisite) and Artifacts:Golden Relic: <i>with heiroglyphs and</i> (misspelled hieroglyphs).

</p>
<dl><dd>Hey, I'm just an ordinary editor, but I can answer your second question. Those descriptions are misspelled on purpose in order to accurately reflect the way they're spelled in the game. I have an old save file with those items in a chest, and I just verified that those (mis-)spellings are still accurate. I don't know about the talk pages, and I don't want to start a rumor by speculating. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 08:19, 26 February 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Oh, you're right, they are misspelled ingame too. Found a third one: Jasper:<i>When polished, this stone becomes attactively luminous.</i> (misspelled attractively). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 09:05, 26 February 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hello Dubesor!  The way to handle in-game misspellings is to place a note on the page that explains that the misspelling appears in-game, as on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Beet" title="Beet">Beet</a> page.</dd>
<dd>If you find relevant info on talk pages, it can be copied to the new wiki.  But, be sure it's current and relevant to the 1.5 game code, and isn't reflected on the actual page for the item already.  There's lots of interesting discussion, but it's outdated and not necessary to migrate it.  So, you have to be careful about what's considered "valuable information".  I'm sure there are some bits that are valuable (like unanswered questions that still need to be researched), so choose wisely.  ;)  Welcome to the wiki!  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 09:12, 26 February 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>OK! Done as with the beets, however Jasper description (attactively/attractively) is only misspelled on the wiki, and spelt correctly in-game. How does one change the description? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 10:05, 26 February 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I just want to mention that if you're interested in reporting typos in the game, you can do so here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../external.html?link=https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/3314/">https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/3314/</a> - <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:41, 26 February 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Just to be clear, you've forgotten your old password?  You're unable to login to the old wiki?  If so, the other Admin can probably recover your password, they will look into it.

<dl><dd>I have now realized that the stardewcommunitywiki still exists, and I'm still logged in there! Is there a way to have my same username here that I did in the old wiki?

<dl><dd>If you have a previous wiki account, it's been transferred here with the same username and password and you'll just need to sign in here. Creating an account won't work because it's been "reserved" already for you. Is it possible you used a different password than you are remembering? - <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Odin" title="User:Odin">Odin</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Odin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Odin (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:23, 3 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The main problem is the forgotten password.  The old database is locked, and there's no way to access it directly.  The key to unlock it would be your password, which would prove you are indeed Polk.  Unfortunately, I don't think there's a way to see your old password on the old site.  It's not stored in cookies in human-readable format.  Without the password, anyone could claim to be "Polk" and request a new password, which would not be good.</dd>
<dd>Despite all that, the other Admin is checking their emails, and will see if anything can be done.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tapper_and_tapped_products"><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper" title="Tapper">Tapper</a> and tapped products</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I feel quite strongly that the mention of crafted products is non-trivial information about the group of items produced by the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper" title="Tapper">Tapper</a> and would like to find a constructive means to include this information somewhere on the wiki. Some of those crafted items like the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg" title="Keg">Keg</a> as artisan equipment and <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Speed-Gro" title="Speed-Gro">Speed-Gro</a> are very useful and I think it's important to know how to find and obtain their crafting ingredients. You have mentioned that there is item-specific information on their individual pages, but I feel like it isn't sufficient for various reasons, such as comparing outputs and planning purposes between the group of tapped product items. I've tentatively added a "Used in" column similar to that on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fish" title="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crops" title="Crops">Crops</a> as a result, but left no changes to the introductory prose.
</p><p>If you could clarify your opinion on your reasoning for this that would be much appreciated &#8211; for example whether you think it's a stylistic issue and the Tapper page should be like <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cheese_Press" title="Cheese Press">Cheese Press</a> (and other equipment, where no mention of the indirect impact on crafts is necessary), or something else entirely. That would be helpful in trying to find out where to best mention the importance of the Tapper and its products in crafting those useful items (such as the Keg as mentioned), such as choosing a different page to note down the information. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Techhead7890" title="User:Techhead7890">Techhead7890</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Techhead7890" title="User talk:Techhead7890">talk</a>) 10:55, 14 March 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>My reasoning is to keep crafted items' pages consistent and avoid bloat (<i>i.e.,</i> duplication of information).  I've placed your table in user space at <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Techhead7890/TapperProducts" title="User:Techhead7890/TapperProducts">User:Techhead7890/TapperProducts</a> for your convenience.  Feel free to change it and add any notes you find personally helpful there.  Thanks!  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:41, 14 March 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>To summarise, some of the problems with the current setup that I've found are: 1) that they are one of the few <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_goods" class="mw-redirect" title="Artisan goods">artisan goods</a> with craftable products (as far as I can tell cheese, cloth, oil, and honey are the four others, compared to 21 which have no craft uses), making the fact the tapped products are used in crafting equipment non-obvious, and more distinct from the tables used on other equipment pages; 2) that they don't have a page or section of their own to discuss them as a group other than the current Tapper equipment page, as <i>all three</i> of the products share the fact they're used in crafting equipment; 3) and the final one is that like with <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crops" title="Crops">crops</a>, it's useful to look forward and see what the crops (or products) can be used for and compare those uses before committing to them, which is a distinct processing and a distinct use of the information as an overview, rather than just duplication &#8211; I think it's important readers can understand what the products can do at a glance, rather than having to open three separate pages to get a full understanding of their choice. I hope this outlines my reasoning for organising the information in the extra column, even though it's a little different to the other equipment pages, and also that the method of organisation is intrinsically useful because of the ability to compare the items.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I originally thought that one way to resolve this would be to follow the model of the item-group pages I listed above (Fish and Crops) and move the craft information and discussion about the products to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_goods" class="mw-redirect" title="Artisan goods">artisan goods</a> to keep it separate from the equipment, while still fulfilling the purpose of having a group page to discuss and compare the products together. However, I've also just noted that many of the product lists there are actually transcluded from the relevant Equipment pages using the <code>#lst:</code> command. This is obviously a bit of a pickle in that both pages would have to match, but <i>if the uses are listed on Crops and that is <b>not</b> considered duplication of individual pages</i>, I actually think it's more consistent to have the uses listed for the artisan goods page also. As a result, I'd like to keep the added column in the table in mainspace (and potentially also add "used in" to the four other artisan goods I listed with craft uses).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>There are a few alternatives; it would be possible to keep the tables separate and keep different non-transcluded versions on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper" title="Tapper">tapper</a> equipment page and <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artisan_goods" class="mw-redirect" title="Artisan goods">artisan goods</a> group page, but that would likely be a maintenance burden; there is another alternative possibility which is to add a section to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Trees" title="Trees">Trees</a> outlining the tapper and useful products together in brief prose. However both of those strike me as perhaps more unnecessary duplication than reworking the table. In conclusion, I've explained some reasons for including the information in mainspace, such as the usefulness of keeping the information on multiple pages as an overview, and strongly ask you to reconsider keeping the "Used in" column in the table, but please let me know what option works best.

<dl><dd>They appear to be unimplemented.  There are many things in data files and in the game code that were thought up, but never used, for whatever reason.

<dl><dd>I've been mucking about with the MainMenu in my Sandbox today. It's better than it was, but CSS changes will be needed to do it right. In addition to the triple-column Valley is the quad-column Items.</dd>

<dd>1. The width of The Valley and its contents don't change. This is probably a .css update, but I didn't try to fix it at this time.</dd>
<dd>2. There's a small vertical spacing issue I couldn't track down. It's probably cell padding somewhere.</dd>
<dd>It's no longer using the doublewidthmenu classes, so unless #1 requires something weird, it could reduce complexity in the .css. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 21:45, 24 June 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Suggestion_concerning_the_Admin_Noticeboard">Suggestion concerning the Admin Noticeboard</span></h2>
<p>Hi Margotbean,
</p><p>I was wondering, are the administrators here at SDV Wiki generally accepting of adding new ideas / things to improve the wiki with? I was thinking of reimagining the administrative noticeboard in order to make it much more efficient for new editors, or otherwise implementing a variety of other QoL features, such as renaming users: this wiki can become so much better.
</p><p>Also, would you mind passing along the news to the sysadmins here to either update or remove the Widgets extension? The current version is <a href="../../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Widgets" class="extiw" title="mw:Extension:Widgets">highly vulnerable</a> and could be exploited. The extension has already had several vulnerabilities in the past, so I'm unsure if it's worthwhile to keep. On the other hand, many other ones, such as RenameUser and InputBox, could come into great use here.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Quest_items">Quest items</span></h2>
<p>Hey Margotbean, I saw another user add Pierre's stocklist stuff to Quests (in English and German wiki) and saw you removed it due to it not being a quest item. So I wondered what the item type actually was, but in ObjectInformation.json 897 (line 673) it is labeled "Quest". But so is <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ornate_Necklace" title="Ornate Necklace">Ornate Necklace</a>, and that doesn't trigger the Quest interface either afaik. Which reference do you use for something being quest?

</p>
<dl><dd>If an item doesn't generate a quest in-game, then it's not a quest item, it's really as simple as that.  It doesn't have anything to do with its category in ObjectInformation.xnb or whether it appears in Quests.xnb.</dd>
<dd>The entire section on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quests" title="Quests">Quests</a> page was created solely for items that wouldn't have enough information about them to warrant their own page, but players looking for information about them could search for the item name and find out what to do with it.  So there are redirects from the item name to the section on the Quests page for those items.  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pierre%27s_Missing_Stocklist" title="Pierre&#39;s Missing Stocklist">Pierre's Missing Stocklist</a> has its own page already, as does the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Ornate_Necklace" title="Ornate Necklace">Ornate Necklace</a>.

<dl><dd>Hi, I added the Stocklist to Questitems because this point in <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Version_History" title="Version History">Version History</a>: „Pierre will sell his seasonal stock all year after fullfilling a new <b>Quest</b>‟ (or something like that).

<p>Hello, I'm trying to create a talk page on the "Quests" Page, as I believe that taking a Special Orders quest alters the in-game probability of some things significantly. (See: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../external.html?link=https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/does-taking-special-orders-alter-the-probability-of-various-aspects-of-the-game.6881/">https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/does-taking-special-orders-alter-the-probability-of-various-aspects-of-the-game.6881/</a>) It isn't letting m. Every time I try to save it just reloads the page with a new Captcha. I am 100% sure I've put in the Captchas correctly, and tried all uppercase, all lower case, capitalizing the first letter of proper nouns, only one word for two word answers (no spaces); nothing seems to work.

<dl><dd>First read <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>, then you can propose changes on a relevant talk page, the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki:Admin_noticeboard" title="Stardew Valley Wiki:Admin noticeboard">Admin noticeboard</a>, or my talk page.  Thanks, <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:44, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks for the link. Firstly I'll give you a bit of a preface: I'm an admin on the RuneScape Wiki. If you're not familiar with it, RuneScape is an MMORPG with over 20 years of content, and updates (almost) every week. The Wiki has existed since 2005, we forked from Fandom back in 2018 and have been thriving in our own domain.</dd>
<dd>I started playing SDV almost 2 months ago and I've noticed some things about this wiki that could be improved based on my experiences with the RuneScape Wiki. Some of these are drastic changes so I'm listing them here instead of obviously going ahead and doing the changes:
<ol><li>More granularity on pages (i.e, splitting up more pages into individual pages). An example of this is having individual pages on each type of <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Roe" title="Roe">roe</a>. While a singular page is easier to maintain, there are way more advantages of splitting this up into their own pages:</li></ol>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><ul><li>One particular roe may have specific behaviour others don't. For example, sturgeon roe makes caviar. Why should the roe page mention it under "Artisan Goods" when only sturgeon roe can?</li>
<li>Reduce confusion for new players. At first I was confused why there's no page for "Potato juice" (an item required for a quest), and I didn't understand about juice until I understood the concept of using Kegs. Individual pages tell users information <b>exactly</b> about the item they want to know about.</li>
<li>Easier to display information on specific pages. Quite frankly, telling me the sell price of roe is 30 + (base fish price / 2) is useless. Individual pages lead to individual sell prices which we can put in the infoboxes.</li>
<li>Calculators, SMW, and categories. I'm not an expert in this field, but more granularity makes it much easier to implement stuff like calculators, where we can extract values out of an infobox from each page, instead of having some huge separate database.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ol><li>More redirects. I know these are easy to make -- is there any specific policy on creating them? Or can I go ahead and make redirects for search terms that don't lead me to a page&#160;:). On RuneScape Wiki, we feature an extension called SearchDigest, which lists the top searched red-links.</li>
<li>More guides/tips/strategies. Easier to do if we split more pages up&#160;:). Imagine a specific page per quest, with its own devoted infobox, and the article mentioning strategy tips.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>Of course, I'm just a new SDV player with some observations. I don't want to come in here and change the style with how everything's done. I'm just here to propose some ideas and ask you for your thoughts. (PS: Sorry for the multiple edits. I didn't realise it wasn't letting me post an external link -- it wasn't giving me any warning lol) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Haidro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Haidro (page does not exist)">Haidro</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Haidro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Haidro (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:14, 12 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The missing redirect / SearchDigest or a similar function absolutely needs to exist. I always wondered why the "Special pages" didn't list failed searches ('Wanted results' maybe?). Editing the German wiki i know for a FACT that there is tons of redirects missing, and search results are shaky at best, but I only ever add a redirect if I happen to stumble upon something obvious missing. And it can't just be taken from the English wiki due to language differences needing completely different redirects. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 14:30, 12 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I'm not sure you read all of <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>.  This wiki strives to be an objective encyclopedia of the game, without walkthroughs, advice, or strategies.  The facts speak for themselves, and suggest mutliple strategies.
</p><p>In addition, every change to the English wiki requires cascading changes in 11 other languages.  So major changes to the English wiki are not something to be taken lightly.
</p><p>There's no need for potato juice to have its own page, because a new player wouldn't encounter the quest until they were familiar with juice in general.  They would receive the information via a <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Quests" title="Quests">Quest</a>, where the information can be found.  Alternatively, they could search for potato juice and find the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Juice" title="Juice">Juice</a> page, which would explain how to make it, if they somehow didn't know already.
</p><p>I appreciate your experience with another wiki.  I don't think it applies here.
</p><p>As for redirects, there's no need to create multiple redirects when a search for the term shows results that get the player where they need to go.  That's a general statement, of course there are times when a redirect is the perfect solution.
</p><p>My best advice is to get to know this wiki before proposing huge changes.  Thanks so much, <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:09, 12 April 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think you misunderstand the purpose of a wiki. It's certainly possible to stay objective while implementing these changes. "The facts speak for themselves" is a bit of a delusional statement, because then you never strive to improve the wiki, and you also insult the players/readers with how much knowledge they should know. My intention with these changes is that you give the players a better experience when using the wiki. Are you really ok with users not being redirected to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mr._Qi" title="Mr. Qi">Mr. Qi</a> when searching for "Mr Qi"? I don't know where your fence is for when to create a redirect, which is why it's better to create redirects for practically any search term. See above to the reply of my suggestions, someone else even suggested this. Potato juice can still be its own page while providing an objective standpoint. If anything, you're being more encyclopaedic by having this granularity. By assuming the knowledge of new players, you forget that there's a certain percentage of them that <i>just don't know</i>. And that's where the wiki is supposed to come in.</dd>
<dd>A fair point about the interlanguage wikis. I'm curious if you have a percentage breakdown on the most popular language wikis? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Haidro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Haidro (page does not exist)">Haidro</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Haidro&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Haidro (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:11, 12 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>@Haidro The redirects and several other things don't appear to follow typical use. There is no cirrus or elastic extensions for fuzzy search matching (many/most wikis on 1.35 do this), common term redirects to help new users find pages without extra click-spend (web usability issue) are deleted (From what I read they don't want to do it in 11 other languages), so users have to scan search results which sometimes don't show relevant items at or near the top (or even on the first page sometimes). This wiki doesn't seem to function like a typical game wiki. The approach seems geared towards reducing edits and content to a bare minimum and synchronizing for translation, to reduce workload. Someone asked what the level of tolerance was for improvement, this seems generally low for other than how currently do things. Given this I'd hazard a guess that core staff is limited and they don't have enough translators. I see they aren't using the usual MediaWiki Language Extension Bundle (to quote its extension page: "used to manage multilingual wikis in a sensible way"), which may discourage some translators. Mediawiki-maintained, built-in 1.35 extensions (suggested here or admin page) don't seem to get enabled, regardless of how helpful they might be. It is unclear why, other than unfamiliarity with updating extensions perhaps?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I get the sense that this wiki is more for the game maker to have basic game documentation than for users to have an optimal game wiki. It is hosted by the game maker, it doesn't fully appreciate bundled mediawiki features and functionality. It seems to be less of a community project, unless editors are willing to only do bare minimal edits, basic no frills info, and nothing approaching usability-related stuff that might require an extra page, extra change, or changes to any significant number of pages. No fancy stuff, a lot of "long" pages (seen in long pages report) and "good enough" docs seems to be the goal rather than "make it good/great". That's fine. Users that want to do substantitive improvement or advanced stuff probably need export and work locally. It would be nice if their Help:Editing page made much clearer the basic mission statement and philosophy, what is welcome and isn't, what they do want and don't (expectations setting and management) so that otherwise helpful MediaWiki editors can onboard more easily to help in the way they <i>want</i>, rather than having negative initial experiences, trying to do what is normal or helpful elsewhere. I'm sure that is the intent, rather that the priorities and <i>reasons for those priorities</i> seem unclear for new users--an area for improvement perhaps, to help reduce workload if they are ever so inclined, though possible this is also not desired. @Haidro RuneScape wiki is awesome btw. I see you guys went the way of SMW over Cargo, I think SD bureaucrats would say a resounding <b>no</b> to SMW due to its maintenance burden (many required extensions, and they won't enable even bundled MW extensions--though also possible they downloaded the core-only version and neglected the normally packaged extensions). You guys have done some pretty special things over there but seem to be English-only (as the other wiki I work on is), which expects users to use built-in browser machine translation. Probably we can't fully appreciate their decision on a manual (and unaided by excellent standard extensions) approach to translation. I too can picture the magic of this wiki with data/other extensions and community TLC, I get it, you just wanted to share a bit of that magic you found and were willing to input time and energy to do it, it was why I came here briefly also. Maybe some time in the future they will expand their staff find their way there themselves.&#160;:) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:CrystalFlower&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:CrystalFlower (page does not exist)">CrystalFlower</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:CrystalFlower&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:CrystalFlower (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 09:09, 4 July 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Hi! Some security questions on Chinese wiki have incorrect answers. Probably because the questions and the answers are translated by machine.

<dl><dd>Thanks for your help! I'm not sure which questions have problems now because that I don't need to answer the security questions anymore :D. The former reply was just an impression. I remembered that when I answered the question the name of the game before, I tried to input stardew valley/Stardew Valley/stardewvalley but none of them is correct. I have contacted them in another IM APP and confirmed that it's because of the new editor restriction. Before the wiki's migration, new editors could create new pages in main namespace. But after the migration, it looks like that new editors cannot create new pages in the main namespace until achieve 50 contributions, but there's no warning for this situation (I'm not sure about this because I created a new account a few moments ago but there's no problem when creating new pages). Anyway, they can create new pages now and thanks for your help! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Horizon98" title="User:Horizon98">Horizon98</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98" title="User talk:Horizon98">talk</a>) 05:11, 13 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>The problem is that <a class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Labeled_Section_Transclusion#Limitations">Labeled Section Transclusion</a> doesn't work across languages.

<dd>I don't know of a solution that's better than linking to the English wiki, since the page is updated so frequently.

<dl><dd>I am aware of this limitation. So I created the page Modding:Mod compatibility/zh on English wiki to transclude the &lt;section&gt; tag in a Chinese article which is on the English wiki, and it actually works. But you deleted the page and I don't understand the reason. Is this because that I can't create a Chinese page on English wiki or another reason? If so, could I move the page to somewhere like User:Horizon98/Mod compatibility/zh? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Horizon98" title="User:Horizon98">Horizon98</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98" title="User talk:Horizon98">talk</a>) 05:00, 14 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Creating a page in your user space would mean that only you or wiki staff could edit it and keep it up-to-date.  The English page is updated so frequently, I think the best solution for the long-term is to link to it from the Chinese wiki.  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:14, 14 April 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Looking at it in the long-term, we don't want to have 12 versions of the same huge page on the English wiki.  There's no reason to transclude instead of link, when all the mod names are in English.

<dl><dd>I can see that, the translation is miles better than the rest of the game files, there are only 2 "errors" in it, one which was the omitted translation of Joja corp (translators probably had no context to work with) and another one where imperative is used incorrectly, but while not linguistically correct it could be argued to be suitable for emphasis. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 09:16, 6 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

I guess it makes sense to not add interwiki for maintenance categories, but for example for the pending deletion category I noticed a lot of pending requests (on German wiki as well as other languages), some dating back to early 2020, even 2019, and so I added the links to pending requests, for ease of use. I don't know if someone checks stuff like that manually or not. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 21:56, 8 May 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>The Chinese link can be deleted from the category.  Generally speaking, if you don't have the ability to delete a page, you needn't worry too much about it, unless there's a page with a swear word as the name or something similar. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 00:38, 9 May 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yea, I am not particularly worried, it's just a bit ugly e.g. when a page is in pending deletion due to for example misspelling, the misspelled word will still show up in search suggestions (such as the German "Schme<b>r</b>tterlingsstall"). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 00:44, 9 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_average_number_of_truffles_being_2.5.">The average number of truffles being 2.5.</span></h2>
<p>I asume this is the talk page you wanted me to motivate the resutlt. I'm sorry if you meant my own talk page.
</p><p>Taking what's on the wiki as given, the first truffle is almost guaranteed, and subsequent ones have a likeleyhood of 3/5 and this can happen several times.
</p><p>The mean value then becomes 1+3/5+(3/5)^2+(3/5)^3.....
</p><p>This is a infinite geometric series, but it does converge, we can find the value like this.
</p><p><br />
We call the value S
</p><p>S=1+3/5+(3/5)^2+(3/5)^3.....
</p><p>S(3/5)= 3/5 + (3/5)^2 + (3/5)^3 + (3/5)^4.....
</p><p>S-S(3/5) = S(2/5)= 1
</p><p>S = 5/2
</p><p>Maybe add "the theoretical mean is 2.5", this is excactly the type of thing I come to the wiki for so I thought it would be useful. I can explain the math in greater detail if you like. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Viktor36&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Viktor36 (page does not exist)">Viktor36</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Viktor36&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Viktor36 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:48, 15 May 2021

<p>Hi, Morgotbean! I just completed a module to display crafting recipes. And it's easy to update the recipe data if there more craftable objects in the future. The module is here: <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Horizon98/CraftingRecipes" title="User:Horizon98/CraftingRecipes">User:Horizon98/CraftingRecipes</a>.

<p>Hello, I was using the wiki to find out catch times for the Catfish and saw it was 6am-Noon on a rainy day in the spring. I kept fishing that day past noon and caught a Catfish around 11pm at least and I caught another one around 1am but lack documentation. can you please add back my edit for the catfish time or at aleast have it set to midnight.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mind_the_gap">Mind the gap</span></h2>
<p>On moblie, i have discovered another glitch on the wiki: when viewing in portrait mode, ocassionally pages will have a massive gap between the picture (i.e the furnace page) and the text below.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Spoilers_for_1.5">Spoilers for 1.5</span></h2>
<p>Hey Margotbean,
</p><p>Its me again!&#160;:) Just wondering, I’ve been looking on random pages to edit (looking if there is a mistake) and I found a page you edited recently but didn’t add a spoiler for 1.5 even though it was added in 1.5. Is there a reason for this? Just wondering and questioning as after all you are a admin and I will mostly check with you, if you edited a page and I see a mistake in my opinion, but if there is a definite mistake I would change. Anyway, thanks for your time! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Snakebeast" title="User:Snakebeast">Snakebeast</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Snakebeast" title="User talk:Snakebeast">talk</a>) 13:00, 4 July 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The spoiler box was meant to be temporary, and never a permanent part of the wiki. At this point (6+ months later), the template has just about outlived its usefulness. It appears on pages where one sentence or image refers to 1.5 changes, and that's too much.  So, yes, I'm not actively adding it to pages, because it will only have to be removed later. It's fine that it appears on pages about Ginger Island, and larger pages with lots of 1.5 info, but I'm not seeking to add it to every page at this point.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fertilizer_-_readd_section_split">Fertilizer - readd section split</span></h2>
<p>Hi Margot, thanks for your tidying up of my various edits over the past week or so. I just wanted to request readding a section to the top of the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Fertilizer" title="Fertilizer">Fertilizer</a> page as the introduction is currently extremely messy.

<dl><dd>Personally, the reason I completely stopped helping out here, despite spending multiple hours almost daily with thousands of edits and hundreds of full page translations (DE), was Margotbean's lack of cooperation (and frankly maladministration). Undoing edits and instantly deleting files for self-induced reason: "unused" without even the slightest courtesy of inquiry or discussion about intent was only the straw that broke the camel's back for me. I'd think the wiki, it's content and most definitely the quality &amp; quantity of its non-English articles would be better off if the admins worked together and communicated with other helpful editors instead of being aggressive, unnecessarily defensive and frankly condescending.<br /></dd>
<dd>Margotbean is a fantastic and hard-working editor (which I also have praised in messaging to CA ~4 months ago) but does indeed sometimes not act as an administrator should. Horizon is also a fantastic asset to the quality and content of the wiki, especially for the much needed CN portion. His recent changes on the schedule reverted an English schedule (most likely useless to Chinese readers) back to the former comprehensible translated version, improving the page. I cannot find a broken policy in <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> (policies should be documented before enforcement) and while I am not sure this wiki is capable (due to "understaffing") to uphold standards such as Wikipedia's "<i>Administrators should not normally use their tools in matters in which they are personally involved (for example, in a content dispute in which they are a party).</i>", things like this would be a total non-issue with communication and cooperation instead of hostility. An unjustified temporary ban might not be the end of the world, but at the end of the day things like this destroy motivation for all volunteers involved. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Dubesor" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Dubesor" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 00:30, 8 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>

I chose a simple project and proposed a couple more. But the unwelcoming admin behavior I could observe toward me and other users made it clear to me this would not be a good investment of my time. I have to wonder how many dozens of times this same story has been repeated.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks, I should have read the whole page before joining. While I appreciated Margotbean's effort and wasn't going to say anything, I feel I should after reading more (here, user talk &amp; contribs, plus page histories &amp; talk pages at <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Special:AllPages" title="Special:AllPages">special:AllPages</a> using namespace drop-down). For every 1 person calling out bad treatment, vastly more will just leave angry. I agree power is leveraged unfairly. I got approval before tasks, felt encouraged and was immediately reversed, citing new edits "didn’t match" the non-updated pages (yep of course, because those were acknowledged by admin prior as needing updates, no update visible in history for cited page, not possible to do all pages at once). Social whiplash results leaving a horrid taste; hard not to wonder if intended. I read answers to helpful, knowledgeable editors which seem intended to provoke, successfully. Also in agreement the wiki <i>appears like</i> a community project (maybe for the benefit of CA?), though edits are discouraged except for well-connected community people.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Lots of similar social whiplash-like things read. Initial words suggest respect, subsequent actions belie it (<b>I'd be doing a disservice to new contributors if not truthful</b>). I must infer there's no one else to do admin duties, or perhaps the behavior is approved given it is hosted and controlled by the developer. The ones speaking out seem knowledgeable of wikis (saw where one guy who created advanced templates relied on, was prevented from improving and suggested improvements also denied after current admin was elevated post-migration from Chucklefish). Connected maybe, as unappealing as that sounds? Maybe CA will one day read and address the issue, since it is becoming a PR and perhaps a sales problem, but probably not. I'd guess these comments will get archived and new contributors won't see them. I won't be buying future games having to rely on "community" resources run this way, sorry CA. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:User6789" title="User:User6789">User6789</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:User6789" title="User talk:User6789">talk</a>) 08:37, 22 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I'm reading all of these comments here and although I'm fairly new to this wiki I support all of the complaints listed above. Margotbean deleted one of my fishing templates because "it has inaccurate info" like literally you could just edit it yourself to make it accurate? and then further removed the content from other areas because "the forge isn't a fishing site" even though the lava eel can be caught there??? Margotbean is an extremely good organizer and editor but not good at administering the site. With the way I've seen edits be undone here, had I not had lots of wiki experience prior to joining this one, I probably would've left as well. I was wondering why the wiki was almost dead aside from several occasional contributors when I first joined and this is why to be honest. If new users aren't welcomed here or feel like they belong they'd just leave. Like I would have done if this was my first wiki here. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:User314159" title="User:User314159">User314159</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:User314159" title="User talk:User314159">talk</a>) 20:30, 23 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Hello folks! This is ColitoCole. I wanted to address some of these concerns. I know firsthand that those who are involved in maintaining the wiki, the forums, etc. want to encourage communication and goodwill. The challenge is, we're an extremely small team and the amount of people who make up the community is very large. In Margotbean's case, Margotbean is doing a lot but they are just one person with limited time and energy. Often times that means that despite doing their best they can quickly become overwhelmed with needed tasks and "to-do items" by no fault of their own. This can lead to communications that may seem brief or blunt. But I also know that Margotbean has a passion for this wiki. Their job is to make decisions about how the wiki is structured and maintained. I rely on them to help maintain the wiki and to use their best judgement. I ask that you please remember these decisions can be difficult and should be respected as much as possible.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

This was the initial question, which he and others never got an answer to. You also mention that there are problems because of such a small team and Margotbean mentioned there are no patrollers besides herself but looking around at some profiles of other heavy-duty editors, most of which Margotbean herself purposefully drove away, I have seen plenty of people who did the roles of translator and patroller without the wiki assigning them those roles. The lack of role filling seems to be a deliberate choice by the current administration. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:JR8&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JR8 (page does not exist)">JR8</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:JR8&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:JR8 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:21, 23 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I didn't ask about the details, even so: the details aren't private, they are openly visible for everyone to see on the wiki, since you didn't communicate with Horizon in private. I asked for which specific wiki policy was violated - the ban reason is 'Violation of wiki policy'. The wiki policy is not private, it needs to be public. So what you are saying is that he did not repeatedly violate a wiki policy, otherwise you could easily link or quote to which policy was violated. The banned user himself asked you what he violated and you didn't answer him, neither in public nor in private. The fact remains that you state bogus ban reasons, and when asked about policy you say it's private. How does that even make sense? You are a terrible, power-tripping moderator. Don't complain about workload with your behaviour when you ban or drive away the very people who reduce that workload because of some weird power-tripping ego-issues <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:JR8&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JR8 (page does not exist)">JR8</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:JR8&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:JR8 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:50, 23 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I see Margotbean disallowing things that appear to stem from a lack of MW knowledge. I see other's comments on this also, as well as missing wiki features that would invalidate the excuses. Excuses or not, there are ways to treat people that are respectful, and ways that aren't. Telling someone they can do something to turn around and reverse that very thing is not respectful. Being short on staff or time is not a valid excuse, the behavior is why the team doesn't expand. <b>Thank you Cole, for at least confirming that the poor behavior appears to be condoned, because at least this lets people know not to waste their time.

Without robust policy documentation, Margotbean <b>does</b> make up the rules as she goes (to agree with the few lines I could read in the vandalism deletion summary--but stop please, vandalism is <b>not</b> the way to handle that). Margotbean also does not appear to treat all users the same. Further, bots are allowed on most wikis for a reason (you have no policy stating people can't, and anyone can edit via the MW API without you ever realizing they're using a bot, as long as it is well throttled). The ability to disable the edit API no longer exists in MW. The banned editor's <i>real</i> mistake was simply informing Margotbean of what she was ignorant to (she never would have known otherwise, if the user kept doing small throttled updates). Banning out of a lack of either knowledge or policies looks punitive, no matter how you slice it. The way things are done here is backwards (the Wikipedia Admin and other's spotted it quickly). Hopefully the other users who complained come back one day, if only to see they made the right choice. You have multiple different users here all saying similar things, which should tell you something.

<h2><span id="Fishing_Mechanics_different_on_Switch?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Fishing_Mechanics_different_on_Switch.3F">Fishing Mechanics different on Switch?</span></h2>
<p>Hey Margotbean,
</p><p>Have you heard anything about the fishing mechanics being different on the Switch?  I caught the following fish on the Switch version:
</p><p>Anchovy, Normal Quality, Not Perfect, No Treasure Chest: +13xp
Herring, Gold Quality, Perfect, No Treasure Chest: +40xp
Anchovy, Normal Quality, Not Perfect, No Treasure Chest: +13xp
Sardine, Normal Quality, Not Perfect, No Treasure Chest: +13xp
Trash/Junk: +3xp
Trash/Junk: +3xp
Halibut, Normal Quality, Not Perfect, No Treasure Chest: +19xp
</p><p>Total: (13 + 40 + 13 + 13 + 3 + 3 + 19) = 104xp.
</p><p>According to everything in the wiki and the game code I decompiled, I should be level 1 Fishing.  However, the skills screen in-game still shows me at level 0.
</p><p>All I can guess is that the Switch mechanics are slightly different.  Have you heard anything about this? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Kn0wmad1c&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Kn0wmad1c (page does not exist)">Kn0wmad1c</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Kn0wmad1c&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Kn0wmad1c (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:23, 15 August 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>If you checked your fishing level on the day before leveling up this isn't a bug because the skills tab updates overnight (or not?).

<p>I found out the issue was that I was calculating on the quality of the fish that was fished up, but on a perfect catch, the quality is upgraded and the formula for XP gain uses the original quality, not the upgraded quality.
</p><p>The real amount of XP should have been 97, since my Gold Quality Perfect Herring should have been worth 33XP instead of 40XP.

<p>Sorry for my flub about Deluxe Speed-Gro. I actually thought I was editing Deluxe Fertilizer. I blame my fevered brain at the time. We've had heat extremes at 40 Celsius coupled with poisonous smoke from forest fires burning literally hundreds of thousands of acres. Our usually mild climate normally requires no air conditioning, but people have died here of the heat alone. I thought I was coping, but it's clear I was more woozy than I had thought.

Early this year, though, a monster heat wave broke all-time record heat by 5 Celsius, hitting a whopping 46.7 Celsius. Thought I was living in the Arabian desert! This one was less high but longer. I thought I had it under control better than I did. Now I'm better aware.

<p>Hello Margotbean! This wiki is fantastic, thank you for all your hard work!
</p><p>My question relates to proper English writing convention and if this is to be followed on this wiki. I notice many sentence fragments, for which the reason for fragmentation is unclear. Some of these are a fragment of 3-4 words. I have fixed some, and some other punctuation and grammar issues, but I now see there are many more and want to make sure that proper English writing convention is the norm here as elsewhere before continuing on the English wiki. I checked the editing page though it does not provide much clarification other than "encyclopedic" style (which does frown on sentence fragments and also instances of addressing the reader informally with such statements as "you", preferring a more neutral tone). Am I interpreting this wiki's definition of "encyclopedic" and "formal tone" correctly? If so, I'm happy to go through all pages and remedy these instances. Thank you for your assistance! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:User6789" title="User:User6789">User6789</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:User6789" title="User talk:User6789">talk</a>) 17:42, 21 August 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Wow, kind words!  Thank you very much!  You are interpreting "encyclopedic" and "formal tone" correctly; the wiki should not use "you" and shouldn't have sentence fragments. The problem is that there are thousands of pages in 12 languages, and only me to patrol them. So, yes, have fun and fix what you like!  The only caveat I have is that all similar pages should read the same, even if the wording is clunky.  So, if you change one fish's page, you should really check all fish pages for consistency. ...A tall order in some cases. Thank you for making the wiki better, and have fun! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 17:52, 21 August 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That is fantastic, thank you. It may take me a little while to go through every page to ensure no more sentence fragments or informal language, but I will happily take this on (apologies in advance for the patrolling work it causes).

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hi again Margotbean, we just talked about fixing sentence fragments, it will take some time to get all pages of the same type to be consistent. I can't feasibly edit all pages at a single time to make them consistent, there's going to need to be some time elapsed between pages where some are not yet updated (editng and considering convention when there are no rules set or posted anyhwere takes time). I see some I have been doing have been reversed with the message "Again, a good change that doesn't match the Iron Lamp-post,"  (which it won't because Iron Lamp-post has not yet been edited). As I mentioned, I intend to go through <i>all</i> pages, but that's going to take some time, during which things won't match. Furthermore, items with differing amounts of information sometimes require information to be broken up slightly differently. As with any writing, the amount of information present affects how the information is divided. I'm not going through them per item type, I'm going reverse alphabetical using the <i>All Pages</i> tool. Sometimes, a bit of flexibility is required in addressing fragments.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>At this point I think it may be better for me to revers all changes I've made to now and let you guys just do your usual thing. Best of luck! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:User6789" title="User:User6789">User6789</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:User6789" title="User talk:User6789">talk</a>) 23:27, 21 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Warp_Totems">Warp Totems</span></h2>
<p>I'm pretty new to the game in general, but I was reading on the Warp Totems (general) page, that usinga Beach Totem will consume the totem but not warp the protagonist. Last night was the Jelly festival year 2 for me, and I was in the mines getting killed.  I warped exactly at "10:00 PM" and it saved my character and the festival event started like it did in year 1 - I got to talk to everyone as though I walked in.  I'm still really new, and there are no festivals in the mountains to test the theory that warping in at the designated times works. Sorry, I'm still learning, but thought that more experienced players would know better how to test something that worked for me before I knew it shouldn't have.  Thanks for all your hard work!

<dl><dd>Hello Lyssa! I'm not sure I understand your question -- did the warp totem get consumed?  It's true, there is nothing on the general <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Warp_Totem" title="Warp Totem">Warp Totem</a> page about exceptions to the rules. In fact, there's nothing on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Warp_Totem:_Beach" title="Warp Totem: Beach">Warp Totem: Beach</a> page about festivals either. Let me see about fixing that. Normally the warp totem would be consumed (before 10pm) but the player wouldn't be teleported anywhere. That may have changed with v1.5. I will do some testing. Thanks for the kind words! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 23:44, 23 August 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
