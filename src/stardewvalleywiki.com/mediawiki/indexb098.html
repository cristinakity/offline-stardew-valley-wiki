==Format==
===Key===
Each mail entry has a unique key which identifies the message (''e.g.,'' to track whether the player already received it). For example, &lt;samp>Robin&lt;/samp> at the start of this entry is the mail key:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="json">
"Robin": "Hey there!^I had some extra wood lying around... I thought maybe you could use it. Take care!  ^   -Robin %item object 388 50 %%[#]A Gift From Robin"
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>

The key can be one of these formats:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! syntax
! description
|-
| &lt;samp>{{t|season}}_{{t|day of month}}_{{t|year}}&lt;/samp>
| Sent on the given date.&lt;br />&lt;small>Example: &lt;samp>spring_15_3&lt;/samp> applies on spring 15 in year 3.&lt;/small>
|-
| &lt;samp>{{t|season}}_{{t|day of month}}&lt;/samp>
| Sent on the given date in any year. This is ignored if mail was sent for the previous format.&lt;br />&lt;small>Example: &lt;samp>spring_15&lt;/samp> applies on spring 15.&lt;/small>
|-
| ''arbitrary key''
| Anything else is just a unique letter ID, which can be sent in code or via [[Modding:Event data|an event script]].
|}

===Value===
The value for each letter entry has this format: {{t|letter text}}[#]{{t|letter name}}.

The {{t|letter name}} field is just a unique human-readable name for the letter, shown in the mail collections tab.

The {{t|letter text}} field is the text to show when the player opens the letter. This recognizes some special tokens:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! token
! description
|-
| &lt;samp>@&lt;/samp>
| Replaced with the player name.&lt;br />&lt;small>Example: &lt;samp>Hello @!&lt;/samp>&lt;/small>
|-
| &lt;samp>¦&lt;/samp>
| Switches between gendered versions of the letter. Male players see the text before &lt;samp>¦&lt;/samp>, and others see the text after it. Only the first instance is recognized. If the text doesn't contain it, all players see the same version.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item object [{{t|id}} {{t|count}}]+ %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach a random item from the listed space-delimited item IDs and counts. For example, &lt;samp>%item object 388 50 %%&lt;/samp> attaches 50 wood; &lt;samp>%item object 388 50 390 10 %%&lt;/samp> attaches ''either'' 50 wood, or 10 stone. See [[Modding:Items]] for a list of object IDs.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item bigobject [{{t|id}}]+ %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach a random big craftable from the listed space-delimited IDs. For example, &lt;samp>%item bigobject 144 163 %%&lt;/samp> attaches ''either'' a stone brazier or cask. See [[Modding:Items]] for a list of big craftable IDs.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item furniture [{{t|id}}]+ %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach a random furniture item from the listed space-delimited IDs. For example, &lt;samp>%item furniture 1142 709 %%&lt;/samp> attaches ''either'' a puzzle table or a walnut dresser. See [[Modding:Items]] for a list of furniture IDs.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item money {{t|amount}} %%&lt;/samp>&lt;br />&lt;samp>%item money {{t|min}} {{t|max}} %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach the given amount of money, or a random amount between an inclusive {{t|min}} and exclusive {{t|max}} value. In either case, the value is rounded down to the nearest 10 (''e.g.,'' 156→150).
|-
| &lt;samp>%item tools [{{t|type}}]+ %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach one or more base-quality tools. The valid types are &lt;samp>Axe&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>Hoe&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>Can&lt;/samp> (watering can), &lt;samp>Pickaxe&lt;/samp>, and &lt;samp>Scythe&lt;/samp>. Invalid types are ignored. For example, &lt;samp>%item tools Axe Scythe %%&lt;/samp> attaches both an axe and scythe.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item conversationTopic {{t|key}} {{t|days}} %%&lt;/samp>
| Start an [[Modding:Dialogue#Active dialogue events|active dialogue event]] for the given number of days.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item cookingRecipe %%&lt;/samp>
| Teach the player the cooking recipe whose requirement field starts with &lt;samp>f {{t|npc name}}&lt;/samp>, where {{t|npc name}} is the mail key with 'Cooking' removed. For example, if the mail key is &lt;samp>RobinCooking&lt;/samp>, this command would find a cooking recipe with a requirement starting with &lt;samp>f Robin&lt;/samp> that the player doesn't already know. You can specify a recipe with &lt;samp>%item cookingRecipe {{t|recipe}}%%&lt;/samp>
|-
| &lt;samp>%item craftingRecipe {{t|key}} %%&lt;/samp>
| Teach the player the crafting recipe with the given ID. The key is the item name. If the item name has spaces, such as "Mayonnaise Machine", use underscores in place of spaces, ie "Mayonnaise_Machine".
|-
| &lt;samp>%item itemRecovery {{t|key}} %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach the item that the player asked [[Marlon]] to find in the mines, if any.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item quest {{t|quest ID}} %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach the given quest ID to the letter, so the player can choose to accept it.
|-
| &lt;samp>%item quest {{t|quest ID}} true %%&lt;/samp>
| Attach the given quest ID to the letter and add it automatically. (If the player has the &lt;samp>NOQUEST_{{t|quest id}}&lt;/samp> mail flag set, it won't be added automatically.)
|-
| &lt;samp>%secretsanta&lt;/samp>
| Replaced with a random town NPC name if the date is winter 18–25 inclusively, else replaced with &lt;samp>???&lt;/samp>.
|}

==Mail flags==
===Overview===
The game tracks ''mail flags'' for each player. This is used for two purposes:
* Tracking received letters. The key for each letter in &lt;samp>Data\Mail&lt;/samp> is a mail flag; if the player has the flag for a letter, the game considers it to be received.
* Tracking non-mail changes in the world. For example, &lt;samp>artifactFound&lt;/samp> means the player has found at least one artifact, &lt;samp>jojaMember&lt;/samp> means the player has a Joja membership, etc. These have no letter associated with them.

You can check the mail flags in-game:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! mod type
! info
|-
|valign="top"| [[Modding:Content Patcher|Content Patcher]] packs
| You can check mail flags using the &lt;samp>HasFlag&lt;/samp> condition. For example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="js">
{
    "Action": "EditImage",
    "Target": "Portraits/Abigail",
    "FromFile": "assets/abigail-bow.png",
    "When": {
        "HasFlag": "Beat_PK" // player beat the Prairie King game
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>
|-
|valign="top"| C# mods
| Mail flags are tracked in three main fields:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! field
! description
|-
| &lt;samp>Game1.player.mailForTomorrow&lt;/samp>
| Letters to add to the player's mailbox at the start of the next day.
|-
| &lt;samp>Game1.player.mailbox&lt;/samp>
| Letters currently in the player's mailbox.
|-
| &lt;samp>Game1.player.mailReceived&lt;/samp>
| All mail flags set for the player. That includes both letters and non-mail flags.
|}

You can either check the fields individually, or use the game's &lt;samp>Game1.player.hasOrWillReceiveMail(string id)&lt;/samp> method to check all three.
|}

===List===
There are far too many flags to list, but here are some useful ones:

; [[Community Center]] and [[JojaMart]]&amp;#58;

==Custom mail formatting==
You can customize mail and [[Secret Notes|secret notes]] by including three custom commands in the letter text (including the &lt;samp>[]&lt;/samp> characters):
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! command
! effect
|-
| &lt;samp>[letterbg {{t|index}}]&lt;/samp>
| Changes the default letter background to a vanilla background from &lt;samp>LooseSprites/letterBG&lt;/samp>. The index can be 0 (default letter), 1 (Sandy's lined paper), 2 (Wizard style), or 3 (Krobus style). This will also set the default text color for that style, unless overridden by &lt;samp>textcolor&lt;/samp>.
|-
| &lt;samp>[letterbg {{t|asset name}} {{t|index}}]&lt;/samp>
| Changes the default letter background to the given texture. The asset name should match a texture containing two rows: one with 320x180 pixel letter background images, and one with 24x24 pixel button backgrounds shown behind attached items. The index is the sprite to use from those rows, starting at 0 for the first one.
Only the first 4 letter background images of a row will be properly displayed.
Only one row of button may exist.
See image below
|-
| &lt;samp>[textcolor {{t|color}}]&lt;/samp>
| Changes the letter text color. The valid colors are &lt;samp>black&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>blue&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>cyan&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>gray&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>green&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>orange&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>purple&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>red&lt;/samp>, and &lt;samp>white&lt;/samp>.
|}


[[File:Lettersbglayers.png|center|thumb|Example : the letters  background images can go on the pale pink, pink and purple spaces, while the buttons can only go on the orange line.]]
