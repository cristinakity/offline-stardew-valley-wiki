{{note box|type=warning|text=&lt;span style="font-size: larger;">'''Console commands aren't meant for general use. Be very careful using them.'''&lt;/span>
&lt;br />They can have permanent side-effects on your save data, break your save, or have other unintended effects. If you don't understand the command, don't use it on a save you care about.'''
}}

SMAPI provides access to hundreds of console commands with a wide variety of effects, ranging from useful tools to cheats to specialized test commands. These are documented on this page.

{{TOC}}

==Format used on this page==
To avoid repeating text, this page uses a few conventions to convey common information:

* Required parameters are listed in angle brackets, and optional parameters are listed in square brackets. For example, &lt;code>speed&lt;/code> {{t|I:value}} {{o|I:duration}} means the command requires an integer value parameter and has an optional integer duration parameter. Details such as default values should be listed in the description.
* The command names are case-insensitive, but their parameters might be case-sensitive.
* If a command description says that a parameter uses "fuzzy" match, that means that it can match on a case-insensitive partial name. For example, &lt;code>abi&lt;/code> would match Abigail if it's fuzzy.

==Console commands==
===How to enter console commands===
You must have the Console Commands mod installed to use the commands listed below. That mod is bundled with SMAPI; if you deleted it, just [[Modding:Player Guide/Getting Started|reinstall SMAPI]] to get the mod back.

You can enter console commands directly into the SMAPI console window (or into the in-game chat if you have {{nexus mod|2092|Chat Commands}} too). You can type &lt;code>help&lt;/code> to get a list of console commands (including commands added by other mods).

  |params  = {{o|S:search text}}
  |desc    = Shows a list of every item in the game (including those added by mods). The optional search text limits results to those which have all of the search words somewhere in their ID + type + name.

==Debug commands==
{{note box|type=error|text=&lt;span style="font-size: larger;">'''Don't use these commands unless you're aware of the possible consequences.'''&lt;/span>&lt;br />These are meant for the game developers, not players. They may crash your game, permanently corrupt or break your save, or cause other problems. Using these in a save you care about is not recommended.}}

===How to enter debug commands===
The game itself has hundreds of hidden debug commands used to test the game. These [[#Console commands|require the Console Commands mod]] too, but '''every command should be prefixed with &lt;code>debug&lt;/code>''' like this:
&lt;pre>
debug where Robin
> Robin is at Farm, 21,4
&lt;/pre>

The example above returned output, but many commands don't. If there's no output, SMAPI will say ''Sent debug command to the game, but there was no output''.

===Macros===
Instead of entering each command directly into the SMAPI console, you can also use the &lt;samp>[[#runmacro|debug runmacro]]&lt;/samp> command to a list of debug commands from a text file. (This doesn't work with the non-debug commands.) Here's how to use it:

# Create a text file in [[Modding:Player Guide/Getting Started#Find your game folder|your game folder]] (with a &lt;samp>.txt&lt;/samp> extension).
# Type commands in this file, one command per line. Each command should start with a slash character (&lt;samp>/&lt;/samp>), but should not include &lt;code>debug &lt;/code>.
# To run the macro, type &lt;code>debug runmacro &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/code> in the SMAPI console, replacing &lt;samp>&amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;&lt;/samp> with the name of your command file without the &lt;samp>.txt&lt;/samp> extension.

For example, let's say you have a &lt;code>quickstart.txt&lt;/code> file with these commands:
&lt;pre>
/backpack 12
/Money 10000
/levelup 0 1
/weapon 5
&lt;/pre>

Entering &lt;code>debug runmacro quickstart&lt;/code> in the SMAPI console will execute all the commands, resulting in a backpack upgrade, money set to 10000g, farming skill set to level 1, and a [[Bone Sword]] added to the player's inventory. (Note: &lt;samp>Money&lt;/samp> is capitalized in this example because if it is all lowercase it triggers a [[Secrets#Chat|special chat response]] instead of executing the command.)

  |example = &lt;code>debug createdebris 24&lt;/code> would spawn a [[parsnip]].

}}
{{/cmd
  |command = fuzzyitemnamed,fin,f
  |params  = {{t|S:itemName}},{{o|I:amount}},{{o|I:quality}}
  |desc    = Adds the specified item to your inventory. This is a fuzzy search and the game will look through objects, craftables, furniture, weapons, boots, hats, and clothes to match it. There is no reliable way to use names with spaces or differentiate items with the same name, so not all items can be accessed with this command. The optional parameters are for stack amount (defaults is 1) and quality (default is 0.)
  |example = &lt;code>debug fuzzyitemnamed sturg 5 4&lt;/code> would give you a stack of five Iridium-quality [[Sturgeon]].; &lt;code>debug fin galaxy&lt;/code> would give you a [[Galaxy Sword]].; &lt;code>debug f grief&lt;/code> would give you a [[Tailoring#Shirts|"Good Grief" Shirt]].

  |example = &lt;code>debug getindex prisma&lt;/code> would output ''Prismatic Shard's index is 74''.;&lt;code>debug getindex grief&lt;/code> would output ''"Good Grief" Shirt's index is 1008''.

Punctuation should be included, but all spaces should be removed from the name (see examples below). If the requested name is not unique, all matching objects will be added. The optional parameters are for stack amount (default is 1) and quality (default is 0.)
  |example = &lt;code>debug itemnamed miner'streat&lt;/code> would give you [[Miner's Treat]].;&lt;code>debug in strangedoll 3&lt;/code> would give you 3 of each of the Strange Doll [[artifacts]].

If the requested name is not unique, all matching objects will be included in the output.

Strength is a float between 0 and 1 inclusive; the higher the number, the more vibrant the color. The dye will mix with the current color so it is sometimes necessary to "reset" the item by dyeing first with white strength 1.

&lt;li>For other non-marriageable villagers, an empty spouse room will spawn and the NPC will move in. They will follow a basic hardcoded spouse schedule and can be kissed (although they won't have a kiss sprite), but they will rarely have dialogue.&lt;/li>&lt;/ul>
