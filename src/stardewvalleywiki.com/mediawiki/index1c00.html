::I took a look and it appears this was an issue with the extension that the wiki uses for captcha checks. It's working fine except when editing in external links -- for now I've disabled the captcha for external links on pages until I can better determine why it's broken.

== Current version on main page should be a template ==

The current version portion of the main page should be switched to a template. Right now, the current version is hardcoded into the page, which means that regular users can't update the wiki for the latest version. Only moderators can. If this were switched to a template, regular users could simply update the template and the main page would reflect those changes without needing to be updated by a moderator. [[User:Pieisnotpi|Pieisnotpi]] ([[User talk:Pieisnotpi|talk]]) 20:26, 20 March 2016 (EDT)
: Correction. Only administrators can. I'll pass this along to an admin, thanks! [[User:Oath2order|Oath2order]] ([[User talk:Oath2order|talk]]) 21:42, 23 March 2016 (EDT)
:: Thanks for bringing this up.  I've adjusted this into a template that's publicly editable.  The version number (and main links) can now be updated by editing [[Template:MainLinks]] -- [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 22:33, 23 March 2016 (EDT)

== New page with fake information; creator keeps blanking the talk page ==

The page [[Setting#Ferngill Republic|Ferngill Republic]] has been created by [[User:JimmyProvince]], but there's no proof that the information is real, and they keep blanking the talk page after asking for credible sources.

== Mouseover ==

I'm not sure if this should go here. If there is time, it would be nice if mouseover functionality was added. This could be done with css or javascript, of which I have little experience with either, and am not sure if I'm even allowed to. I'm unsure if it could be one in other ways. This could be useful in places like when a Food is listed on a non-[[Cooking]] or item page, where source would say "Cooking" and hovering over the Cooking would give the ingredients required to make it. Currently when Food and non-food are in a table together, we have to add an extra column specifically for ingredients, making the ingredients be a hover over thing makes more sense to me. Same could be said for Crafting. If it can be done, maybe in [[Mediawiki:Vector.css]] or something similar, it could be translated onto a template and made simple enough for everyday editors to use. I have no idea how much I'm asking but it'd be appreciated if it could be done. -- [[User:Kapra|Kapra]] ([[User talk:Kapra|talk]]) 17:42, 25 March 2016 (EDT)
:I really don't know if that would be worth adding. I know it's a statistical outlier, but Wood, for example, would have a MASSIVE hover-over text. I feel like it'd be more trouble than it's worth. [[User:Oath2order|Oath2order]] ([[User talk:Oath2order|talk]]) 20:55, 3 April 2016 (EDT)

== Improveing individial Items Page ongoing ==

I am improving the item page to make it easier for player to find a specific characters based on the image provided. Instead of just using Name.

::Judging by their recent edits, such as the [[Wild Horseradish]] page, it looks like they are changing the lists of NPCs that like the item. Personally, I think the portraits are a little big and the tables to narrow to justify using tables. Maybe using an inline version of [[Template:NPC]] would be a better compromise? --[[User:Samutz|Samutz]] ([[User talk:Samutz|talk]]) 18:59, 5 April 2016 (EDT)

== Anonymous page Dissapearing ==

I edited the skull cavern page, including a walk through of how to get into the skull cavern without fixing the bus, that edit has mysteriously Disappeared 
I would expect a warning or notice before an edit gets taken down, (unless it contains offensive language, which it didn't), It was removed by an unusual
User. I am furious, however, that I did not receive notice of an unwelcome deletion, I was merely trying to help people and then I find out that someone 
Does not want others to help people... anyway, I would appreaceiat if this was looked into... [[User:Wolf478|Wolf478]]
:That exploit/bug had already been fixed in March 2016. Please check the [[Talk:Skull_Cavern|Skull Cavern talk page]]. Also, when making an edit, check "Watch this page" on the bottom, and regularly check your [[Special:Watchlist|Watchlist]]. --[[User:Lilly|Lilly]] ([[User talk:Lilly|talk]]) 20:11, 6 January 2017 (UTC)

== Gift template for item pages ==

I'd like to start using a template I made, [[Template:GiftsByItem]], for the gift sections on item pages. Currently these sections are in mixed formats and incomplete. I've also created a script to generate the necessary wiki code based on the game's data (NPCTastes.yaml) and code, and another script to semi-automate updating the pages since there are a ton of them. The wiki code script can be viewed [http://samutz.com/mecha/stardew/item/426 here] if you'd like to see the results. I wanted to run this by the admins/mods first to ask if this is okay. I've made a second [[User:MechaSamutz|account]] for the update script in case it needs to be marked as a bot. --[[User:Samutz|Samutz]] ([[User talk:Samutz|talk]]) 14:59, 8 April 2016 (EDT)

== Asking for permission of translating this wiki ==

I am working on building a Chinese version of Stardew Valley Wiki ([https://www.stardewvalleywikizh.com/ www.stardewvalleywikizh.com]). I set mediawiki up and have translated some pages from this wiki. I know the licenses is CC-BY-NC-SA but I think I should still let you guys know. I am also going to ask for the permissions of using images in the game from CA. I will make sure that everything translated from this wiki will have corresponding credit and a proper link to here. I want to make sure I have appropriate permissions before I started promoting it so there is just only me editing right now.

Also I want to have the permission of using this mediawiki theme. I have already copied it from [[MediaWiki:Vector.css]] as you can see. The license only applies to content not the style so I think I should ask it separately.

I am going to use this account `UglyBot` to automate the process of translating content from this wiki and I will limit the rate of the bot crawling. (I'm not asking for bot permission, this bot should be read only).

Please let me know if there are any issues of my website (like things I shouldn't use). Thank you.

== Getting bombed by spam ==

I don't know how to contact admins directly, but we're getting bombed with spam articles right now!
: Thanks, should have it cleaned up now. Setting up some better measures to try and keep it from coming back. -- [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 15:48, 25 April 2016 (EDT)

I think it'd be reasonable to automatically delete any page containing the words "cannabis" or "marijuana". That seems to be the majority of what we're getting at the moment. Why the hell are they targeting this site of all places, anyway? [[User:Hammy2211|Hammy2211]] ([[User talk:Hammy2211|talk]]) 07:24, 24 May 2016 (EDT)

== Infobox forced width? ==

I'm trying to make an [[Template:Infobox building|Infobox building]] to create some dedicated articles for farm buildings. I'm running into problems with the infobox size, however, as I don't seem to be able to change the size of images, they stay forced at a particular width and just pixelate if I decrease the image size (see [[User:Samwalton9/Silo]] where the image is currently set at 50px). Is this because of the &lt;code>#infoboxborder&lt;/code>/Infobox Styling settings in [[MediaWiki:Vector.css]]? If so, what's the reason for infobox forced width, and how do I get around this for forcing an image size? Thanks, [[User:Samwalton9|Samwalton9]] ([[User talk:Samwalton9|talk]]) 18:08, 27 April 2016 (EDT)
:: It looks like the issue was the css for "locationimg" which auto-sizes to 90% of the infobox width. That works for the format of other building images, but the silo scales strangely.  I went ahead and just removed that id declaration from your template, it will display sizes at whatever the original image size is. I also added width as an optional parameter, so if you want to define a display width you can do it right in the template. Take a look at the change I made to your userpage. Hope that solves the issue. -- [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 17:02, 28 April 2016 (EDT)

== Search sometimes not working? ==

Any idea why search seems to not work sometimes. For example, I wanted to find out where on the Wiki mentions the [[Well]], but [http://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=default&amp;search=well&amp;fulltext=Search the search] finds nothing, despite the fact that I know it's written in places. [[User:Samwalton9|Samwalton9]] ([[User talk:Samwalton9|talk]]) 06:18, 29 April 2016 (EDT)

:That's a feature of the underlying Mediawiki software (I was involved in the original development of Mediawiki, which is my "nerd badge" I guess). Mediawiki was specifically designed for Wikipedia, and was created when the original software stopped coping with the 200,000 pages Wikipedia had at the time (2003). 

:One specific aspect of the design is that if the search finds a page with your search term ([[Well]]) it immediately stops searching for the word anywhere else. (If you then go to that page and then click "What Links Here" you will find all the pages which link to "well"). This was designed to prevent the search engine trying to search through the entire Wikipedia database (which would slow down the entire system). However, on a small wiki like this the search would not be hard at all. I think there is an option in the sysdamin control panel to disable this behaviour, but we'd need the Chucklefish wiki admin to handle that.

== odd registration... ==

I had a huge struggle registering an account (the captcha is pretty difficult when you're dyslexic haha..) but I got it after like 6 tries. Anyway, now I have an account but... it's not mine... It's registered with a username and email I have never heard of and certainly didn't input and shows edits to pages that I didn't make... What happened?

Hello, I'm the real owner of the account, which I think I might have made at the same time as you. We apparently now both own this account?? What the heck is going on lmao. Why did someone else get access to my account

OP here.. Not sure... But I'm going to log off now and try to log into my own account... LMAO Just thought the admins should know that this happened. Sorry for the confusion but in relation to the edit I made on the health page, it's true.

Alright sorry for deleting it then I was just very confused because I hadn't made that edit haha. No worries it is really weird that this happened though


I was able to log in through my own account.. just thought I'd link it here

is this of importance? When I made my account it asked, why are you making another account? I was confused but I just put in, this is my first account.

== Many pages have encoding issues ==

Many of the longer pages have invalid character encoding, for example [[Wallpaper]].

See this validator report: https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fstardewvalleywiki.com%2FWallpaper

Some browsers can recover from this issue by removing content blocks, but sometimes they can’t. For example, this is how the Wallpaper page looks in Safari right now: [[Media:CharacterEncodingProblemsSafari.png]]

Tracking down encoding issues is really difficult: it could be a bad copy-paste, or MySQL, or MediaWiki not forcing UTF-8 encoding. [[User:Karew|Karew]] ([[User talk:Karew|talk]]) 14:58, 6 August 2016 (EDT)
::This looks like it just started happening last week, we setup HHVM on the server so I'm thinking it's a compression setting that can be easily rectified - thanks for the heads up.

== The wiki should use HTTPS ==

The wiki is currently serving all pages and taking all form submissions over plaintext HTTP. That means that your edits, logins, and cookies are all being sent in the clear over the internet. The wiki should really be set to use HTTPS-only for all operations. I would be willing to contribute my own money to buy a 3-year SSL certificate for the Stardew Valley Wiki.

== Captcha problems ==

How am I supposed to answer them? I keep trying to add a topic to File_Talk:George_Icon.png but it keeps saying I fail the captcha.
:Example: ''"What is the second digit of the number five hundred twenty-three million seventy-four thousand eight hundred fifty-six?"'' and I answer with '''"5"'''.
I have also tried writing out the number in word form as well doing reverse order of the digit (in this case, I would answer "2"). What gives? [[User:Kektklik|Kektklik]] ([[User talk:Kektklik|talk]]) 04:43, 20 October 2016 (BST)
::I realize I'm not an admin, but I can answer this question.

== Plums are now fruit ==

== Template:Infobox requires support for multiple professions ==

Rancher now applies it's bonuses to Artisan items created from Animals, see here:

Currently we are only able to add one profession, where in the case of Mayonnaise, either Rancher or Artisan can apply.

I'd edit it myself but I'm not familiar enough with the syntax, really first time venturing into wiki editing.

== SDV Shop Schedule Chart ==

At the request of a Redditor, I uploaded my shop schedule chart to the wiki, and made a page for it (http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Shop_Schedules). It could definitely use some cleaning up, but more importantly, I wasn't sure what should link to it, and how. It seems like it would make sense to link all the shop pages to the schedule, but I'm not sure the best way to handle it.

== Captcha asks for the nth digit as they appear (lexical order?) ==

The nth digit is ambiguous. Ask an engineer, they'll tell you the first digit of 123456789 is 9. This is called numerical order. The wiki captchas ask for lexical order, that is, what is the nth digit from the left. Maybe the captcha should make mention of this?
:That's a good suggestion which could alleviate some confusion, thanks [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 18:15, 5 January 2017 (UTC)


== Multi language possibility ==

Soon the developers want to release a beta version with language packages in Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Russian, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese. To keep this wiki no.1 it should be possible to offer the sites in different languages. I tried to start translating into german but couldn´t find a way, so I think it´s not possible yet.
If there is a way but I´m just too blind to find it, feel free to contact me. [[User:Flave|Flave]] ([[User talk:Flave|talk]]) 12:38, 21 January 2017 (UTC)

== Calendar has no images, but there are invisible links for peoples birthdays and festivals. ==

[[User:GlassDeviant|GlassDeviant]] ([[User talk:GlassDeviant|talk]]) 09:38, 23 February 2017 (UTC)

Fixed using an unusual solution from the Mozilla support site, in case anyone has this problem in future it is the second last item in the list. You will have to add the boolen value browser.display.use_document_colors=true which is missing in the latest version of Firefox. So it is not a SDV wikia problem.

== Import Math Template ==

Hi! I was editing the [[Crops]] article and I noticed in the "Gold per Day" section the used formulae is pretty ununderstandable. When I began to edit I tried to use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Math Template:Math] but it doesn't exist here.
I've been reading and I found [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates#Copying_from_one_wiki_to_another this page] where it sais I can Import the Template from another Wiki. I couldn't import the Template due to permissions, so I'm writing this hoping for an Administrator to do it. The Importation process is really easy and I'm completely sure this template will be used in a lot of others articles.
That's all. I really hope someone can help.
[[User:Santiago|Santiago]] ([[User talk:Santiago|talk]]) 02:10, 7 May 2017 (BST)
:Hey this template looks great! I started to set it up and once I got into I realized the styling used in our formulas isn't that complicated and it looks like are a bunch of other template dependencies to make it work like it works on wikipedia.  I'm going to opt not to set this one up, I don't think we need all that template overhead to format formulas. Thanks for the suggestion though! [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 13:13, 8 May 2017 (BST)
::That's true. Wikipedia has a lot of articles about math and that's why the template is that complex. However, I think it would be useful to implement at least a part of the template to be able to display formulas that are more pleasing to the eye. Another option would be to be able to implement LaTeX code, since for example, with a simple "\dfrac {} {}" you get a pretty fraction.

== Support for languages that the game is not yet translated to ==

And about the Polish section, won't be in the next patch, but maybe you could let him try now? :)
::We're going to hold off until the translation comes out (or enters beta) since it's not clear what the final translated names will be for things it'll keep things much cleaner, and prevent us having to redo things and have the wiki in a semi-wrong state when the update comes.

:That's exactly it - I've pushed the edits for the honey page now though. [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 12:23, 18 December 2017 (UTC)

== Add Scribunto extension? ==

[[User:Katzeus|@Katzeus]] Can we install the [[mw:Extension:Scribunto|Scribunto extension]]? It's installed on Wikimedia wikis like Wikipedia, so it's stable and well-tested. It lets us write templates using the Lua programming language in the Module namespace, which makes them much easier to read and maintain. That'd be really useful for replacing template code like this:
{{collapse|example code ([[Modding:Mod compatibility/entry|source]])|content=
&lt;pre>
|- id="{{{name}}}" data-status="{{{status}}}" {{#if:{{{source|}}}|data-has-source}} style="line-height: 1em; {{#switch:{{{status}}} |ok=background: #9F9; |workaround=background: #CF9; |broken|soon|soon-official=background: #F99; |obsolete=background: #999}}"
| {{#if:{{{url|}}}|[{{{url}}} {{{name}}}]|{{{name}}}}}{{#if:{{{name2|}}}|&lt;br />&lt;small style="font-size:0.75em;">(aka {{{name2}}})&lt;/small>}}
| {{{author}}}{{#if:{{{author2|}}}|&lt;br />&lt;small style="font-size:0.75em;">(aka {{{author2}}})&lt;/small>}}
| {{#switch:{{{status}}} |ok=✓ |workaround=⚠ |soon|soon-official=↻ |broken|obsolete=✖}} {{#switch:{{{status}}}
  |ok       = {{#if:{{{summary|}}}|{{{summary}}}|use latest version.}}
  |#default = broke{{#if:{{{broke in|}}}|&amp;#32;in {{{broke in}}}|n}}{{#if:{{{summary|}}}|, {{{summary}}}|{{#switch:{{{status}}}|broken={{#if:{{{source|}}}|, needs update from the author|, not open-source}}|soon=update coming soon|soon-official=author will update it soon}}.}}
}}

== New Grange Display Calculator - can't edit it myself ==

I have created a new version of the Grange Display Calculator linked to on the Stardew Valley Fair page. It is based on the one currently there, but is easier to use as it has sell values built in, so you only need input the item name and quality, and it will work out the value from there. However, I cannot add it to the page myself, as adding external links is automatically blocked as harmful. The link is here: docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18487ASpJ2zsydCrL6eUHCgoQVHbwYypSUxWBbF1Vz5Y/edit?usp=sharing

I have had to remove the https from the start of the link so the same problem doesn't happen here.

Hopefully an admin can make the addition. If you want to give credit, say "by EX_plode (based off /u/mordenkainen's work)"

== Autosignature Feature ==

Per a recent comment on [[Talk:Harvey]], I'd like to suggest that an autosignature feature be added to the Wiki for edits on Talk pages and other community discussion pages. While Wikipedia doesn't do this, it has a lot more frequent and sophisticated contributors who know what to do, but here we end up with a lot of text that's not labeled with the commentator. Lookup via page history is clumsy and may require searching. [[User:Butterbur|Butterbur]] ([[User talk:Butterbur|talk]]) 07:18, 10 January 2018 (UTC)
:Thanks for the suggestion. I'll look into this functionality and see what's involved. [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 11:41, 10 January 2018 (UTC)

== MediaWiki API Access ==

'''I made this post on the user talk page for Katzeus but felt I might want to also post it here as it seems more fitting:'''


I'm currently developing a Stardew Valley Discord bot that makes the information on the wiki available to users through Discord as well. The main issue is accessing the data.

I've read that wiki's running on MediaWiki can have an API for developers to access but I'm unable to find anything about this on the SDV wiki. I'd love to be able to create this bot as I don't see any out there that focus on Stardew Valley specifically (see [https://discordbots.org/search?username=Stardew%20Valley discordbots.org] for example).

If you'd like to speak to me directly, you can reach me on Discord at Alcha#2621 or any of my other accounts I have on my [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Alcha user page].

P.S. The bot will, of course, be open-sourced under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license and available on [https://github.com/Alcha/Rasmodius here], on Github.

== Non-official translation (French) ==

'''Hello''', I would like to translate few (or every - if I have the time) pages of this wiki in French. I saw before in the thread that you are only supporting official languages right now (Q: [https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Stardew_Valley_Wiki:Admin_noticeboard#Can_I_translate_into_Vietnamese]) but I'm asking anyway because I think it can be very useful for some players. For information, if I'm authorized to translate it I will use the French translation of the patch [https://steamcommunity.com/groups/sdv-fr] for all in-game names and sentences. '''Thanks'''. [[User:Gadish|Gadish]] ([[User talk:Gadish|talk]]) 22:46, 4 February 2018 (UTC)

== External reference for Giant Crop watering edit ==

I need an admin to add an external reference for me.  The [[Crops]] article states the center crop of a 3x3 grid must be watered in order to produce a giant crop. It's not clear whether watering must continue after the center plant is fully grown.  If you only have the basic watering can and no sprinklers, it's impossible to water that plant without harvesting it.  I found some discussion at https[colon-slash-slash]www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/75ieu0/how_can_you_water_a_fully_grown_plant/#thing_t1_do6xso6 including a couple users who claim you can still get a giant crop even if you stop watering once the constituent plants are fully mature.  I tried to add this link as a reference but the site complained I need to reach out to an admin to do that.  (I'm a new user, maybe I don't have rights). [[User:Rkagerer|Rkagerer]] ([[User Talk:Rkagerer|talk]]) 09:33, 14 February 2018 (UTC)

== Relax external link restriction on modding pages? ==

Hi! External links are common in the modding namespace (e.g. to Nexus Mods or the Chucklefish forums), but new users are prevented entirely from posting them. That makes it difficult for modders to help maintain the modding pages. Can we whitelist certain domains so new users can link to them, or relax the restriction in the modding namespace? —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 14:38, 14 March 2018 (UTC)&lt;/small>

: [[User:Katzeus|@Katzeus]] Can we tweak the filter settings? I'm essentially the only person who can edit the modding pages, since every other modder who tries gets filtered. &lt;small>—[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 17:56, 25 April 2018 (BST)&lt;/small>

::: Yeah, sorry this hasn't been working well. I've relaxed it for the modding namespace specifically - let's keep an eye on it though, it may need some small adjustments. [[User:Katzeus|Katzeus]] ([[User talk:Katzeus|talk]]) 11:57, 11 May 2018 (BST)

==Added [[multiplayer]] page==
I created the [[multiplayer]] page with the publicly announced info about how multiplayer mode works.

== Mass Edit by New User ==

Hey, I made a page consolidating all of the heart event cutscenes. I'm not planning on being particularly active on this site, but a bunch of people I talked to said that it would be useful, and I've already created it. What should I do?
:I saw this edit. A heart events page isn't a bad idea, but manually copying all the events in isn't the best way to do it - you're just creating another page with duplicate info which needs maintaining. Eventually edits in one place or the other will make the pages out of sync and it'll be a mess. I think using [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Labeled_Section_Transclusion transclusion] would be a better bet for something like this, then you can reference the character pages and the information will only live in one place.

Gifts will randomly reset midweek and sometimes won't. I've had the gifts reset on any random day of the week (not including sunday).
I've also had the issue of gifts not counting? I've given Lewis and Marnie 3 gifts in one week but only one cross is marked off. Similar things happen all the time no matter the person I gift to.
I've tried finding what could cause it but no idea so far since it's different people, days and items most of the time.  [[User:MuffinGamys|MuffinGamys]] ([[User talk:MuffinGamys|talk]]) 15:24, 03 June 2018

::::No worries, though I might have a suggestion for you.  Since all your game assets should be pixel art you might want to put 
&lt;pre>
-ms-interpolation-mode: nearest-neighbor; /* IE */
image-rendering: -webkit-optimize-contrast; /* Blackberry */
image-rendering: -moz-crisp-edges; /* Firefox */
image-rendering: crisp-edges;
image-rendering: pixelated; /* Chromium */
&lt;/pre> in your body which changes the image interpolation of various browsers.  
&lt;pre>
image-rendering:-moz-crisp-edges;
image-rendering:-o-crisp-edges;
image-rendering:-webkit-optimize-contrast;
-ms-interpolation-mode:nearest-neighbor;
image-rendering:crisp-edges;
image-rendering:pixelated;

== Curious bug pending to add to the Luau event. ==

After the Luau on the first year is completed, if you go to The Community Center around 10:30 PM-11:30 PM (I went because I was intending to put some items that day), you can see Demetrius going to the fountain. If you activate the dialogue with him, he is going to give the same answer that he gave at the Luau (the one that he tells Robin he is tired and wants to go to the buffet).

Please consider on putting this as a kind of trivia since it does not appear neither at the Luau´s nor Demetrius´s webpage (even Demetrius´s schedule does not show that he goes to the fountain at that time).

Regards,
Koalitaforce.

== BUG - Master Angler Achievement Awarded 59 Fish Caught, Not 62, in Beta ==

So pre-beta there were 59 fish to catch.  Beta added three new fish, the Midnight Squid, Spook Fish, and Blobfish.  The Master Angler achievement reads "Catch every fish", but I was just awarded it on the beta after having caught 59 fish, and not the 59 originals:  I caught all 3 of the new ones, but I am still missing Legend, Mutant Carp, and Dorado, yet I just received the Achievement.

Seems like the tracking on the Achievement counts the number of distinct types of fish a player's caught, and when that number hits 59, they're awarded the achievement, regardless of the fact that there are now 62 fish to be caught, rather than checking every fish type to see if a player has successfully caught one of those types.

==Add FAQs page==
We have a [https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/wiki/faq FAQs page on the subreddit] for the most common questions from new players, with links to the wiki for more info.

:I'd be really hesitant to add that kind of redundancy to the wiki.

==Handling new content in the upcoming release==
Stardew Valley 1.3 will [https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1020331132003368960 officially release on August 1st]. On that day, many players will be searching for info about the new content but often won't find it on the wiki — either because the wiki doesn't have it at all (like [[Auto-Grabber]]), or because it's hidden in a collapsed footer section (like [[Abigail#v1.3 Beta Changes]]). Can we start preparing for the update by adding the missing information to the regular articles (clearly distinguished to avoid confusing 1.2 players)? —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 20:16, 20 July 2018 (BST)&lt;/small>

==Mistake on Maru’s loved gifts, golden pumpkin gifting==
Hello! I signed up so I could try and edit a mistake I found but it’s a tad confusing, and I didn’t want to mess up anything that’s already been done.

== Proposed fix for collapsible elements breaking section links ==

When a page has collapsible elements, section links often break because the page jumps away after JavaScript loads ([[Abigail#Eight Hearts|see example]]). [https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/11/chrome-now-uses-scroll-anchoring-to-prevent-those-annoying-page-jumps/ Chrome has a feature to fix that], but other browsers like Firefox don't. I suggest adding this snippet to [[MediaWiki:Common.js]], which just moves the page back to the linked section after JavaScript is loaded:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
$(function() {
   if (location.hash) {
      var anchor = $(location.hash).get(0);
      if (anchor)
         anchor.scrollIntoView();
   }
});
&lt;/syntaxhighlight>
(You can try the snippet by adding it to [[Special:MyPage/common.js|your &lt;samp>common.js&lt;/samp> subpage]].) —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 17:02, 25 December 2018 (UTC)&lt;/small>

== I can't create my own user page ==

I recently joined this wiki, and I tried to put some stuff in my user page, but the site told me it wasn't allowed because it was a "mass edit by a new user". I'm more than a little miffed at this, because besides my own user page, I haven't actually edited anything (I had the source of one page open to copy info over, and at one point I had the "add topic" page for this page open to write this, but until I post this, I haven't changed a thing on this site). Can someone fix this please? Thanks. [[User:Calis|Calis]] ([[User talk:Calis|talk]]) 18:02, 27 February 2019 (UTC)

== Lucky Purple Shorts ==

Aight, so I'm tired of trying to search for info about it and not finding it easily or efficiently, so I tried to make a page for it (which got blocked due to an "unacceptable page name"). I believe it would be helpful to have a searchable page for this item to consolidate all the info about it (as well as other quest items that have different reactions when used in unexpected ways, like Robin's Axe). 

-- [[User:SuperSarcosmic|SuperSarcosmic]] ([[User talk:SuperSarcosmic|talk]]) 08:34, 31 May 2019 (BST)
:"Aight", I'm not sure what was unacceptable about the page name, but I've added a section to the [[Secrets]] page for the shorts and created a redirect.  FYI, there shouldn't be any special uses for the axe or Linus' berry basket, and the shorts shouldn't come in iridium quality after choosing the Botanist profession.  You may need to update your game version, if possible, because it sounds like you're running a beta version of 1.3.  If you find iridium shorts with the latest version (1.3.36), you should report the bug on the forums (link in left sidebar).

== Trying to add new page (but my account is still too new) ==

Hi Admins,

I've received the "Mass edit by new user" restriction that is preventing me from adding a new page. The page I'm adding is related to the unused bus scene (a screenshot of which is currently found in the [[Bus Stop]] page). I decided that there was enough information on the topic that it was worth creating its own page instead of just adding it all to the Bus Stop page. Unfortunately, I do not have the privileges to do that at this time. The page I was trying to create was going to be named "Bus Ride (Deleted Scene)". Any chance I could get help adding this page? Thanks.  [[User:Biochromatic|Biochromatic]] ([[User talk:Biochromatic|talk]]) 04:44, 10 June 2019
:I think the contents of the deleted scene would fit better in a collapsable section on the Bus Stop page.  If you add it, please be sure to clean up the text by removing formatting marks like "$u" and "$s#$b#".  Also, it's important to add the name of the data file where you found the text.  
:The "mass edit" restriction is not time-based, but based on the number of edits you've made, so you will most likely have to add the information to the page in smaller increments.  Just save in-between edits, and you'll be able to add it all.  Good luck!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:49, 10 June 2019 (BST)

== Redirected to SCAM site ==

Hi!
On most pages (for example: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Marnie ) I get redirected to a SCAM site that tracks my IP and shows a SCAM that tries to lure me into it's real. It claims to be Swedish Company Telia but it is obvious it is not. This has happened very frequently for the last couple of days and it is irritating to say the least. What makes it worse is that when I get trapped into the page I cannot use the back button in my browser, I have to go to into the Wiki and the correct page clean every time.

I always loved this site and have had a ton of use from it but at its current state it is more irritating and frustrating than useful.

Thanks.

PS. I have the screenshot and the URL if needed. I tried to link to the screenshot but I was disallowed :( DS.

== Dialogue of night time Expansion ==

Hello, I am a player who loves Stardue Valley very much. (Because I've been playing games in offline mode a lot, I haven't recorded all the play time playing I have about 5000 hours of play time.) Before I ask you a question, I'd like to say that I'm very poor at English, and I don't know how to write this type of document. I'm very worried it.

on the subject I'm doing a lot of work on decorating the Dialogues in Stardew Valley. I am adding various concepts to my favorite characters and new stories such as vampires and werewolves. But there's a little bit of a little bit. I'm trying to expand Dialogue using CP mode. Editing the part of Dialogue after the marriage, that is, the Dialogue of night time (Rainy, Indoor)_Night_ (here number) is a little small to represent the spouse. I thought there was a lack of conversation patterns at night. I wonder if there is any way to increase this. I've done a lot of work, and I know a lot of Dialogue's token and command. When I looking at the other mode and I wrote down the command and played it. but it didn't work. If there is a way I don't know, or if there is a problem that is completely impossible, please answer it.

P.S. -- I somehow figured out how to use CP mode to increase the number of seasonal Night Dialogues a little bit. (although I'll need more study) But I want to write Night Dialogues on a particular day. I'd like to know more about the details. [[User:Stardew P|Stardew P]] ([[User talk:Stardew P|talk]]) 01 September 20:59

== Request to add a visual editor (Extension:VisualEditor?) ==
Wikipedia has this visual editor that can help other people to save more time editing pages. Having a visual representation in real-time of your edit can reduce the time that it takes to repeatedly click 'Show preview' and fixing your edit, if applicable. I don't know much about extensions—like if it work in custom wikis like this wiki—but it might be that the visual editor is supplied by [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:VisualEditor Extension:VisualEditor]. I'm not really saying that no one uses the source editor and that it should be removed, but this might be a great addition. [[User:KLaurence|KLaurence]] ([[User talk:KLaurence|talk]]) 03:44, 1 September 2019 (UTC)

: Yep, it works fine on custom wikis. It's a bit harder to install than most extensions though, since it needs a separate Node.js service. —&lt;small>[[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) 06:36, 2 September 2019 (UTC)&lt;/small>

:Please note that there can be quite some bugs with the VisualEditor. I used it for a time, and it was very useful for knowing what's what in tables, but it could suddenly crash or wipe changes, or become unresponsive. Perhaps it has been improved now, this was probably a year ago, but I'd be wary about implementing such an extension. However, something like [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:CodeMirror CodeMirror] may be useful. Makes it easier to see and work with tags when making edits. It works with the default WikiEditor. [[User:Pangaea|Pangaea]] ([[User talk:Pangaea|talk]]) 17:20, 13 December 2019 (UTC)

== Wiki Style Guide ==

Hey guys,

I was wondering if there is a kind of style guide for adding/editing articles on this wiki. Right now, for example, I'd like to know if in-game typos are taken over with a corresponding note (as seen on [[Polka_Bow|Polka Bow]]) or if they are corrected (as seen on the german page [https://de.stardewvalleywiki.com/Kokosnuss Kokosnuss]). Both examples refer to the in-game description of the respective item as you can see them in the info box.

In general, I would appreciate an editing style guide that answers questions like this and also clarifies common sense rules like "be polite", "do not spam" etc. Ideally, it would be linked from the main page or shown as soon as you edit something such that it's easy enough to find. So far, I've tried searching for keywords like "style", "guide" or "rules", as well as skimming through this page, the [[Special:SpecialPages|Special pages]] and [[User_talk:Margotbean|Margotbean's talk page]] but found nothing.

Cheers, [[User:MadMarty28|MadMarty28]] ([[User talk:MadMarty28|talk]]) 21:17, 12 December 2019 (UTC)
:As far as in-game typos, they should appear on the wiki as-is, with a note explaining that the typo appears in-game.  There is a kind of style guide, linked to from the main page where it says "anyone can edit" -- the page is [[Help:Editing]].

== Monster drop inconsistencies ==

There is some inconsistency with including or not including the drop chance beside the monsters items drop from. Most items do not show the drop chance on their pages and the percentage is only shown on the monster's page, but there are exceptions to this, for example the Earth Crystal and Bomb pages both have "x% chance" beside each monster. Is there a consensus as to whether the drop chance should be displayed or not? And if so, should it say "x% chance" or just show the percentage?

== Changes Lists ==

Anyone can show a list of changes to an article or talk page going back to the start: choose a list size, time interval, and proceed earlier or later at will. Not so with "recent changes". Yes, I understand "recent". But I've returned after a necessary absence of 3 weeks and can't get back very far in what must be a long list. In fact, in the past, I have been unable to see all the changes that occurred in the prior 12-18 hours or so, even showing the complete 500 changes allowed. So "recent" may require some interpretation, but the limit of 500 is absolute and, I would argue, too small. Is there some reason we cannot look further back? I find it hard to believe that there is no need at all (I have needed to), and I also find it hard to believe that there are so many occasions to want to look far back that it would introduce lookup problems or inefficiencies for the Wiki. Can the article look-back feature be turned on for recents? [[User:Butterbur|Butterbur]] ([[User talk:Butterbur|talk]]) 20:58, 14 January 2020 (UTC)

== Apply to be a Bureaucrat / Administrator of Chinese Stardew Valley Wiki ==

Chinese Stardew Valley Wiki are rarely found by Chinese players. At present, Chinese novice players play games through forums. The only Huiji wiki is also moved by the content here and hasn't been updated for several years.

I have several years of MediaWiki experience in Chinese Minecraft Wiki. I hope Chinese Stardew Valley Wiki can be found, edited and updated by Chinese players. If it fails to meet the requirements, please tell me the reason and hope to reply as soon as possible.

I'm only interested in patrolling vandalism if I am simultaneously recruiting. I expect some of our vandals to become our best editors. Are you saying such a view of human nature is inappropriate here? It's unclear whether it's "entirely inappropriate" or just needs a bit of "care".

== Overly enthusiastic autofilter completely blocks new user contributions ==

I just attempted to revise the XP section of the [[Farming]] page to expand the tables it contained with additional useful information. Everything looked great until I tried to save, at which point I got the error message "This action has been automatically identified as harmful, and therefore disallowed. If you believe your action was constructive, please inform an administrator of what you were trying to do. A brief description of the abuse rule which your action matched is: Mass edit by new user."

I'm not sure what the point is of requiring people to sign up to contribute if you're still going to block them from contributing something as small as updating a single section of a single page. I get wanting to block "mass edits," but it seems like that should kick in after someone is making ''substantial'' changes to ''many'' pages; not expanding three tables in a single section of a single page. It also seems that I am not the only person to encounter this error.

[[User:Eponymous|Eponymous]] ([[User talk:Eponymous|talk]]) 18:35, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

:The changes you made were pretty substantial, expanding one screenful of info into 3 screenfuls.  A vandal could do a lot of damage with fewer bytes; thus, the spam filter exists.
:As for the specific changes, the info you added might be better on a separate page, or discussed on the [[Talk:Farming|Farming talk page]] first, a common practice for discussing large changes to pages.  My personal opinion is that it would be best as a separate page, linked to from the [[Farming]] page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:15, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

== Adding external links to portrait guide and sprite guide ==

I'm trying to add some example guides for portraits and sprites on the Modding:NPC_data page, but adding the links has been identified as harmful. I've removed the https part at the beginning of the links to avoid the issue here.

== Octopus &amp; Crab Pot Fish ==

I noticed an error with these fish pages, it seems the infobox for fish is not coded to accept "inedible" as an option for healing effect. For now, I have changed them all to effect level 0 and added a line to the opening paragraphs explaining that they cannot be eaten unless they are cooked.

If anyone has the technical know-how to change the coding on the infobox it may be more clear to have them marked as inedible there, but I don't know how to do so. 
:An immediate fix is to use -300, which is how inedible is handled in game code; see '''Template:Edibility'''.  Inedible is supposed to work, but there’s an error somewhere in [[Template:Infobox fish]]. I was about to do a major update to Infobox_fish in the next day or so, at which point I’ll make sure the bug is fixed properly.

== Uncompletable quest ==

I am in Winter, Year 1, on a new playthrough. I accepted a quest from Leah off the Bulletin Board to catch a red snapper for her. But the red snapper isn't available in Winter unless you have a Rain Totem, which is impossible to get in Year 1. It requires resources not readily available, such as truffle oil, which requires either getting a pig, or hoping the Merchant has a truffle that can be made into oil. Please consider removing this quest from appearing in Year 1. It might not be an issue further along in the game, but in the beginning, it's irritating trying to complete something that cannot be easily completed. Thank you.

Hi, I wanted to clean up and fix errors in schedules. I wanted to do this on my userpage so I could work on it without disrupting the main page until I was finished.

== Why did the domain change? ==

The wiki's domain name has changed from &lt;code>stardewvalleywiki.com&lt;/code> to &lt;code>stardewcommunitywiki.com&lt;/code>.

* I'm curious as to why? Is the wiki losing control of the old domain?
* 301 redirects appear to be set up correctly, but also perhaps a notice should be posted informing people because things like cookies, password managers, scripts, etc will probably break or become disconnected with this change.
* The site's privacy policy and legal documents need to be updated to reflect the new domain. I assume regular editors cannot do that.

==Issues with Cloudflare defense==
[[User:BolingH|BolingH]] ([[User talk:BolingH|talk]]) 02:37, 10 January 2021 (UTC): I suggest that the Stardew Cereal Wiki should remove the extremely extensive cloudflare bot detection blocking for web access services from mainland China IP fields, and optimize the quality of access. The reasons are as follows:

First, Simplified Chinese is the most widely used Chinese variant in the world, with the largest number of native speakers. However, the vast majority of users of Simplified Chinese reside in China.

Secondly, cloudflare's bot detection interception has caused a dramatic decline in the number of web visits to the official Stardew Valley Chinese Wiki, and has had a permanent impact. This led to the official Chinese Wiki being overtaken by a branch of huiji wiki in multiple search engine rankings.

Thirdly, the unfriendly access environment for Simplified Chinese users caused by the first two has backfired on the official Wiki, resulting in the Chinese branch lacking updated content for a long time, with a large number of words aging badly and new words not being synchronized in time. On the other hand, this has exacerbated the fact that a large number of Chinese users prefer Huiji Wiki as the indexing target, and the official Chinese Wiki has lost a considerable number of potential users.

== Mass Edit by New User ==

I added the data for Ostrich Eggs to the Animal Products Profitability, but since it's a mass edit, I can't push it through on my own. I'll try to find some smaller updates to make to avoid this in the future, but in the meantime, could someone make sure it gets added so I don't have to re-edit it later?
: Well isn't this a pretty kettle of fish. I just went through and did the same edit that you did but I also can't push it through. I'll try sending it in in a few parts too.

== Cutscene with George ==

After completing the Leek-based special request provided by Evelyn you get a short cutscene in which George is surrounded by presents - it's not mentioned on the page so I thought I'd mention it in case nobody got it yet. I got it when entering the house when George was home during the Day.

: Thanks for pointing this out! This quest was introduced with the 1.5 update. It does look like [[George]]'s page does not mention the quest yet.

== Stardew Wiki Discord? ==

Since Stardew Valley's new update, I was wondering if there was a discord to easily communicate between editors? If not than I think it would help majorly with conveying information, for example, why isn't the summit page finished? Has nobody gotten to the summit yet? And any other questions, a discord would help astronomically. I have experience in making discords and I could probably set one up (with relieving myself of the owner position of course, after I finished) Just asking because I've looked for a discord but could not find one, just feels like there is a lack of communication. Thank you.

== Upload File - Licensing drop down ==

Hey! I've added a couple images for various articles, and I'm been manually adding the licensing section after the fact. I noticed there's a "Licensing" drop down on the Upload Image page, but when I look in the drop down, the only option is "None Selected." Is this something that maybe needs to be updated? Otherwise I can continue adding the "License CA" template after upload. (I couldn't find any guidelines around image uploads, but it seemed like every image I looked at had the licensing disclaimer, so I wanted to err on the side of caution and include it). Thanks!

== Fixing a dead link in game troubleshooting ==

One of the issues on the trouble shooting page page includes a link to the Microsoft XNA framework but the download was taken down by Microsoft so I want to replace it with a link to the Wayback Machine where you can download it but cant because I can't add links. I spent like three hours trying to get this fixed and so did another guy I know so having this changed would have saved the two of us a total of about 9 hours of trouble.

== Editing description/tooltip of items ==

I noticed that the Qi Fruit description is now incorrect, because it now says the correct amount of 500 instead of 1000. However, I don't think there is a way to edit it. Can someone fix it? Thanks. [[User:Arsonist|Arsonist]] ([[User talk:Arsonist|talk]]) 02:18, 6 February 2021 (UTC)

== Displaying graphics in the wiki pixelated ==

I encourage you to try to set the global css rule "image-rendering: pixelated;" to improve the quality of graphics in the wiki.
The difference becomes well-noticable in the [[Animals]] section about Cat or Dog.
Stardew Valley is a game with pixel graphics, after all.
