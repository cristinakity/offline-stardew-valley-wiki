== shop keepers already at counter at 6AM ==
with the addition of the key to the town I checked some schedules and they are in line with the hours listed in characters\schedules however when rushing to stores in the mornings I noticed several already being at their counter and was able to buy/sell stuff. 

Tested on Y4 Fall 28, Sunday and at 6:20AM for each exmaple: Clint/Pierre/Marnie were at counter. Gus was standing in his room, and Robin was sleeping. Willy went to go fish. 
Is this something that needs to be considered for schedules or is a small note in the key page enough? [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 22:19, 17 March 2021 (UTC)
:First we need to determine if they stand at their counters before obtaining the key to the town.  That would be specified in their schedule files.  If so, then it can be added to their regular schedules.  If not, then it should be a note on their schedules pages (and the shop pages). [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:04, 17 March 2021 (UTC)
::Clint stays at his counter until 5pm. This is reflected in the Wiki. Even before you get the Key, if you get in his building before 4, he will still help you after 4. After the Key, you will get served as long as you're there by 5.
::The Adventurer's Guild seems to be open all hours once you have the Key. I haven't actually tried to make a beeline there first thing in the morning, but I have been there after 1am. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 01:40, 18 March 2021 (UTC)
::: schedule files are same as wiki schedules, however ingame behaviour is different from schedule files as they occupy the counter much earlier than in schedule files; i don't know where the game code decides when an NPC stands behind a counter (I tried looking but could only find checks on doors that are disabled by "Game1.player.HasTownKey;"). As for the the Adventurer's Guild i also checked that at 6:20AM and it was just like open (behind counter and can shop).[[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 13:38, 18 March 2021 (UTC)
::::Ah, you're correct - I see that Pierre's schedule file says he should be in bed till 7am, but after obtaining the key, he's at the counter at 6am.  I think, to the original question of where the info should go, it should definitely be in a note on the villagers' pages and not part of their regular schedule tables.  Then we can simply test in-game after obtaining the key, and forget all the code-diving.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 13:46, 18 March 2021 (UTC)

== Oasis/Sandy/Casino ==
The [[Oasis]] page, [[Sandy]]'s page, and this page all have different information about festival days. One says it observes all festivals, one says most festivals, and one only says Winter 25. Only Sandy's page mentions her birthday, but it's short on details. The [[Casino]] page says it never closes, which can't be true since you have to go through the Oasis to get there. I think it must be available on Sandy's birthday, because I was able to get into the Oasis one time when Sandy was away from her desk on her birthday (I didn't try to go in back, though). [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 01:58, 18 March 2021 (UTC)
: I know from memory (a few weeks ago) that when Sandy hangs out in the desert with Emily on her birthday (Fall 15) the Oasis stays open, but you cannot shop because of the failed "sandy.currentLocation == this" check. The casino never closing is correct, as none of the interior or npcs move/stop being interactable. The casino "open hours" are tied to the Oasis due to the player having to pass through the door on entry (Oasis door only since Casino has no door/doorcheck after bouncer is gone). As for Winter 25 I just chedked a few minutes ago and the Oasis was open and Sandy tended the shop. Checked at 9AM and 10:20PM and nothing is closed. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 13:17, 18 March 2021 (UTC)
::Is the Oasis open on festival days, but there is no way to get there or is it really closed, also when using a warp totem/obelisk? [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 21:02, 10 April 2021 (UTC)
:::Well, it used to be closed on all festival days.  With v1.5 (or before?) it is now open on the Feast of the Winter Star.  Pam drives the bus on festival days, so you don't need a Warp Totem/Obelisk.  I'm not sure what other festivals it may be open with v1.5, if you have time to test that, that would be a plus!
