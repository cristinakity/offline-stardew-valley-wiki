'''Journey of the Prairie King''' is a SmashTV-style minigame that can be played on one of the arcade machines in [[The Stardrop Saloon]]. Beating the game will award the player with a [[Prairie King Arcade System]], delivered by mail the next day. [[Abigail]] also possesses a console version of the game that can be played during her 2-Heart Event. Random elements of the game are '''''not''''' affected by [[Luck]].&lt;ref name="CAquote" />

''Please note that none of the power-ups or enemies are referenced by any name in-game, so they have been named by members of the community.''

==Gameplay Mechanics==
Journey of the Prairie King is a top-down shooter, resembling [[wikipedia:Shoot 'em up#Types|"twin-stick"]] shooters such as "[[wikipedia:Smash TV|Smash TV]]". {{Key|W}}{{Key|A}}{{Key|S}}{{Key|D}} moves the character and {{Key|&amp;uarr;}}{{Key|&amp;larr;}}{{Key|&amp;darr;}}{{Key|&amp;rarr;}} shoots. The player can move and shoot diagonally by combining two keys (''e.g.,'' W and A together move up and left diagonally). While using a controller, the left joystick moves, and the right joystick shoots. The D-Pad can also be used for movement and the button pad can also be used for shooting.

In the mobile version of the game, there are two transparent red circles. The one on the left moves the character and the one on the right aims.

The player begins with four lives (shown as "x3" in the upper left), and is instantly killed upon contact with an enemy or projectile.  Losing every life (when the counter changes from "x0" to "x-1") results in a Game Over.  In each level, a timer bar counts down at the top of the screen while waves of [[#Enemies|enemies]] appear from the edges of the screen and move toward the player.  Enemies stop spawning when the timer bar has counted down completely, and the level is completed when all enemies are defeated, allowing progress to the next area.

Enemies will sometimes drop [[#Items Dropped by Enemies|power-ups]], coins and extra lives upon being killed.  One power-up at a time can be stored in a slot in the top-left, and can be activated by pressing {{Key|Space}}.  If a power-up is picked up while another is already being held, the new power-up is consumed immediately.  Power-ups last only for a short time.

|}

==Upgrades==
A Vendor appears after certain levels are completed and will present the player with three upgrades that can be purchased with coins dropped by enemies (see above).  Only one item may be purchased per visit, and the items in each slot are always presented in the same order, requiring the first item in that slot to be purchased before the next one is shown in a later level, etc.  (For example, both boots upgrades must be purchased before an extra life can appear in the first slot.)

The Vendor appears at the end of every second level: 1-2, 1-4, 2-1, 2-3, 3-1 and 3-3.

|Cowboy
|
|Both fights with the cowboy take place in open fields with little cover. The player and cowboy are separated by a ravine/river, which can only be crossed with a lucky smoke bomb. The cowboy will run out of cover and shoot a volley of bullets upwards, sometimes matching the player's movements, before retreating back to cover. He often pauses behind cover, and sometimes outside of cover.  Upon dying, the boss drops an extra life, a bridge appears crossing the river, and a raft pickup appears which sends the player to the next stage.
|Stage 1 (area 5), Stage 2 (area 4)
|-
|[[File:Boss3.gif]]
|Fector
|
|Fector is the final boss and is significantly more difficult than the Cowboy. Movement is not restricted on this stage, for the player or for Fector. Fector can fire directly at the player, or in eight directions as with the Wheel power-up.  As his health decreases, he starts summoning enemies. The player is victorious after defeating Fector.

==Hard Mode==
After completing ''Journey of the Prairie King'', the player has the option to start over in Hard Mode. All upgrades and coins are carried over into the new game, but lives reset to the default "x3", and held power-ups are removed. Enemies spawn in greater numbers, some move faster, and each has at least one extra hit point. Additionally, Imps now spawn in every level except boss stages, and extra lives drop far less often.

Each time a harder mode is beaten, the option to start once again is offered, with the game getting progressively harder each time.

==Saving Mechanics==
The game autosaves after each completed level (upon entering the next level, not when the exit opens up) as well as each death. Your held item, upgrades, lives, and time left in the current level will all save. Whenever you exit a run in progress and return to the game later, you can resume playing from the autosave or start a new run from the beginning.

The game does ''not'' autosave if you die during a boss fight. You can exploit this to retry the boss fight until you beat it without losing any lives. You can also abuse the save system further by going to sleep after completing each level and restarting the current day whenever you die, so that you can continue from the save before you died. Both of these techniques can allow players to get the Fector's Challenge [[Achievements|achievement]] more easily.

==Trivia==
* There is a [[Lost Books|Lost Book]] about this game titled ''[[Lost Books#Journey of the Prairie King -- The Smash Hit Video Game!|Journey of the Prairie King -- The Smash Hit Video Game!]]''.
* [[Options#Graphics|Zoom level]] also influences the portion of screen the arcade game takes up.
** If the zoom level is high enough, parts of the screen will be cut off. Playing on the default zoom level in windowed mode results in enough cutoff to hide the time bar at the top.
* The title of the game is most likely a reference to the [[wikipedia:List of River King video games|"River King" games]] (a series of fishing RPGs made by Marvelous, who also made the Harvest Moon/Bokujo Monogatari series), specifically the Game Boy title released in the US as ''Legend of the River King''.

==Bugs==
* If the nuke power-up is used during the first boss fight, the enemy will vanish from the screen but the stage will not end, resulting in a softlock. This also occurs when using the Tombstone power up against Fector.
* Leaving the game while in the Gopher carrying sequence after defeating a boss, then continuing it, will cause the boss music and health bar to reappear on continuation, with the boss spawning as soon as the next stage begins. If the player dies (the boss will despawn in that case) or the boss dies, the music will keep playing until they reach the next boss. Additionally, performing the glitch again on the next boss will cause the music to carry over out of JotPK and into the rest of the game. This will not end until Stardew Valley is completely restarted.
* Leaving the game just before the Gopher carrying sequence begins, then starting a new game, will cause the Gopher carrying sequence to happen anyway before the first level begins while still resetting your upgrades, lives and coin counter as normal for a brand new run.
