<dl><dd>Hello Cody! I'm sorry your introduction to the wiki wasn't a pleasant one. You have a point about non-in-game achievements being on more than one platform. My question is, how should we distinguish them from in-game achievements, or platforms that have no achievements other than the in-game ones? The term "Steam-specific" is used to describe all non-in-game achievements on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Achievements" title="Achievements">Achievements</a> page. I don't think calling them "non-in-game achievements" is very good, what would you propose? Thanks, <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:07, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>No worries! It's kind of tricky because on playstation, they're not even called achievements, they're "trophies". Maybe a solution would be to add columns for each platform to the the table on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Achievements" title="Achievements">Achievements</a> that indicate if the achievement/trophy is present on that platform or not.  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cody (page does not exist)">Cody</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cody (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:41, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>You know, that's a great idea! Maybe we could add one column called "Platform", and use small icons instead of platform names, to save space. We have icons for PS4, Xbox, and possibly Steam. We should probably include gog.com, although I don't know if they have the same achievements as Steam. (They do for some other games.) Let me hunt down some proper icons and see how it looks. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:53, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I like the platform column idea! I checked and GOG doesn't list achievements as a feature for Stardew, so I think you can omit that one. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cody (page does not exist)">Cody</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cody (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:53, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Well, I made a "patch" to the page that should help. It seems that 3 platforms have the same achievements/trophies, and the rest have no extra ones. So, it seemed like adding a column that contained the same 3 icons would be pointless. As a compromise, I renamed the icon heading from "Steam" to "Platform" Icon. If there are Switch or mobile achievements, we can always add those too. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:11, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Nice! There's actually one exception: Playstation has a trophy that (I think) none of the others have called "Iridium Seal" which is a trophy for getting all the other trophies. (All playstation games that have trophies have a "platinum" trophy like this, for getting all the others.) Also, I think the Achievements article could use a section explaining the distinction between what you're calling "in-game achievements" and "platform-specific". On Xbox, for example, <i>there are no in-game achievements</i>😱, so someone reading who only plays on Xbox would probably be confused about what that was referring to.<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cody (page does not exist)">Cody</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cody (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:22, 14 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What?! You're saying that on Xbox the entire achievements tab is missing or grayed-out or something? No way... that's just too strange... 😲</dd>
<dd>(Also, thanks for checking out the GOG achievements, I thought I was going to have to install GOG Galaxy just to check. Oof.) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 00:25, 15 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's not greyed out, it's just not there at all. i.e. there is no achievements tab on the collections page.</dd>
<dd>Here's a screenshot I just took: <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:Collections_tab_on_xbox.png" title="File:Collections tab on xbox.png">File:Collections_tab_on_xbox.png</a><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cody (page does not exist)">Cody</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cody (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:11, 15 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>This is crazy! It's been almost 6 years, and I had no idea the Xbox version didn't have an achievements tab. Of course, I don't own an Xbox, but you would think it would've come up in conversation at some point. I wonder if it was always this way...</dd>
<dd>It seems more edits to the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Achievements" title="Achievements">Achievements</a> page are in order. Thanks for the screenshot, Cody! It's been an eye-opening conversation. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 04:11, 15 February 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Now I wonder if there's an in-game achievements tab on playstation 😝<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Cody (page does not exist)">Cody</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Cody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Cody (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 05:06, 15 February 2023 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Friendship_Perfection">Friendship Perfection</span></h2>
<p>In the Locations section, the article lists the requirement for the stardrop resulting from friendship with player's spouse to be 12.5 hearts (which is 3125 points). The Stardew Checkup helper app, however, lists the requirement explicitly as 13.5 hearts (3375 points). I don't know which is correct, but I thought maybe it might be useful to check. MouseyPounds has always been very reliable, and it would be good for both to be in synch.
