== Potluck Quality rules of thumb ==
It seems that anything worth around 100g is considered good (apart from fish, where 93g is enough). Conversely 30 energy/15 health usually seems to be enough except for forgeables. Does anyone have any other rules of thumb on what gets a good response at the potluck? [[User:Techhead7890|Techhead7890]] ([[User talk:Techhead7890|talk]]) 06:24, 28 February 2021 (UTC)
:The actual rules are a bit more complex and can be found in &lt;samp>StardewValley.Event::governorTaste&lt;/samp> in the game code.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 09:56, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

==Secret Response==
So what is the "secret" response from the governor when adding the shorts to the potluck soup? I sort of want to find out myself, but I'm not a patient kind of person. [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 14:02, 3 April 2021
:I suggest you google it, someone has probably made a video of it.  Please remember to sign your posts with four tildes.  Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:18, 3 April 2021 (UTC)
Also apparently if you put a staircase in the soup the governor and the Mayor will act like you put the pants in the soup. This is almost definitely because if you put a staircase in your pants slot, you get Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts. Even so, it's weird.

== Putting magma cap in the correct place ==

I seem to be triggering an AbuseFilter rule when trying to put magma cap in the correct alphabetical order under the "Best result" heading - anyone else wanna do it? Same for taro root in section below. [[User:Haidro|Haidro]] ([[User talk:Haidro|talk]]) 11:32, 13 April 2021 (UTC)

== Luau response tier formula ==

I noticed that the formula for how each item was categorized was not on this page. I did some digging and found it. I have created a basic write up of the logic that is used, but I am new to contributing to wiki pages so my formatting is fairly poor and I am not certain where on the page would be most appropriate to add this information.

I cannot put what I wrote here as the wiki thinks its too large of an edit

--[[User:CAlonghair|CAlonghair]] ([[User talk:CAlonghair|talk]]) 00:13, 8 May 2022 (UTC)

EDIT: I figured out that I could put it on my userpage. Feel free to check it out there
--[[User:CAlonghair|CAlonghair]] ([[User talk:CAlonghair|talk]]) 00:23, 8 May 2022 (UTC)

:The code reference is above -- &lt;samp>StardewValley.Event::governorTaste&lt;/samp>. I'm not sure we have all multiplayer options covered, but the complete list of items covers the rest of what's on your user page. I don't think it adds value, but I appreciate the effort! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:06, 8 May 2022 (UTC)

::Oh yea I saw that name, but I wasn't sure how that would lead me to seeing the actual formula. The reason I wanted to know the exact formula was for playing with mods reasons, as modded items would not be on this curated list obviously, but could still be used in the luau. This page referenced a formula, but wasn't specific in how it worked. Other pages, like [[Farming]] have a more precise description of formulas in dropdowns (in this case the one about profession goods boost) so I thought it might be reasonable to add something like that for this as well. [[User:CAlonghair|CAlonghair]] ([[User talk:CAlonghair|talk]]) 05:02, 8 May 2022 (UTC)

:::It's not entirely unreasonable, but I think a code reference will suffice for this page. I went ahead and added one. Good luck with your modding efforts! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:14, 8 May 2022 (UTC)

::::I must say I find an exact formula easier to consume than the long list of individual items. The item lists are not formatted in a convenient way for looking up specific items, while a formula at least provides a straightforward method for those wanting to determine for themselves. [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 11:16, 13 September 2023 (UTC)

:::::I see that you have the algorithm on your user page now, that's great! What I've been thinking would be ideal is an external web page that lets the user input an item and quality, and outputs the governor's response. Maybe something hosted on github.io, like the [https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/ Stardew Predictor] or [https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-fair-helper/ SDV Fair helper]. Unfortunately, the wiki doesn't have the capability to allow for the same kind of input and output. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:26, 13 September 2023 (UTC)

== Bug for a Staircase being added to the potluck ==

Since of 1.5 fixing the bug of you being able to add a [[Staircase]] got me thinking: This needs to be fixed ASAP. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:58, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
:ConcernedApe doesn't monitor the wiki for bug reports, but you can report the bug on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/ Official Forums]. I think it's already been reported, but it doesn't hurt to report it again. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:50, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
