<dl><dd>I have a page in my user space like that:  <a href="../User_Margotbean/IngredientsShortList.html" title="User:Margotbean/IngredientsShortList">User:Margotbean/IngredientsShortList</a>.  It takes a full page, so I wouldn't want to add it to the crafting page.  A separate page, with a link on the main page would be a better solution.  <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:03, 24 February 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skill_Links">Skill Links</span></h2>
<p>The skill links on this page are a bit inconsistent, as some of them go directly to the related pages and the others go to the corresponding section of the <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> page. I think it should be one or the other for the whole page but which one? <a href="../User_Js_Wizard.html?title=User:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">Js Wizard</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Js_Wizard.html?title=User_talk:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:14, 30 March 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>main pages because if you are crafting you don't care about professions at that point, you wanna know about what that skill is, the experience gain, etc. so it should all go to the main page (e.g. someone wants to craft Iridium band the combat requirement should link to [[Combat]] and not [[Skills#Combat]] imo <a href="../User_Dubesor.html" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Dubesor.html" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 19:28, 30 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>If the links go to the appropriate section of <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a>, then translators have an easier time translating them, since <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> is usually created before any of the individual skills pages are.  <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:54, 30 March 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Good point, and it is likely that <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> was created first in the English wiki too, so it would make sense for links to generally point to the first created content. <a href="../User_Js_Wizard.html?title=User:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">Js Wizard</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Js_Wizard.html?title=User_talk:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:02, 30 March 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>True but the sections in <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> do seem to contain the kind of information in which they would be most interested as well, namely how to level up in the skill and what the skill unlocks at each level. Professions are just part of the same table as the crafting unlocks, which is in both the sections of <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> and the main articles. Also, the extra information in the main articles seems to be more about the activities related to the skill and not specifically about experience and leveling up (which should be the focus for the crafting recipes). It does have some more specifics in some cases as far as amounts of experience and whatnot, but the sections in <a href="../Skills.html" title="Skills">Skills</a> do have links to the main articles so users can always use those if they want more information. <a href="../User_Js_Wizard.html?title=User:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">Js Wizard</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Js_Wizard.html?title=User_talk:Js_Wizard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Js Wizard (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:02, 30 March 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Edible_Items">Edible Items</span></h2>
<p>I've only confirmed this for <a href="../Life_Elixir.html" title="Life Elixir">Life Elixir</a>, but I'm guessing that for each item in the Edible Items list, despite being created via crafting and not cooking, that once created the game then classifies them as 'Cooking'. Offhand I'm guessing each of these items should be included in [[Category:Cooking]] or somehow otherwise be discernable as ultimately Cooking items. <a href="../User_Jankyupeblik.html?title=User:Jankyupeblik&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Jankyupeblik (page does not exist)">Jankyupeblik</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Jankyupeblik.html?title=User_talk:Jankyupeblik&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jankyupeblik (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:59, 8 May 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>The classification is an artifact of the way <samp>ObjectInformation.xnb</samp> uses categories.  To add it to the wiki would be confusing, and we have <a href="../Category_Recipes.html" title="Category:Recipes">Category:Recipes</a> to take care of the oddball cases like this. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:04, 8 May 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Beach_Villager_Path_Risk">Beach Villager Path Risk</span></h2>
<p>Hopefully this is the right place to show this issue. The summary is the Moonlight Festival is a risk for placed items since this cutscene loads the base beach map, and the NPCs are standing/walking in a bunch of spots that are otherwise marked as safe to put stuff down onto.
</p><p>The bottom right of the center dock on the beach (the dock with willy's house) isn't completely safe. If you attend the Moonlight Jelly festival, Clint will destroy what's on the bottom right of the dock. For some reason the festival loads the normal beach map when the jelly cutscene occurs. I didn't catch him in the act for this screenshot, but you can see here he walks around that area. The recycling machines I put down there are gone.
Also, a few other otherwise safe path spots seem to be at risk in this cutscene. Where the player and their spouse stands plus Kent/Jodi seem to invalidate another couple safe spots, as well as Sam at the left and Sebastian on the far left (he's barely pictured but he's there).
</p><p>I'll see about showing this on the villager-path imgur or something. If it's appropriate, I think a warning about this cutscene may be worth mentioning somewhere, or the original image being edited to account for this cutscene. I think this event is the only real risk for the current safe dock spots so maybe the former's the best option.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wild_seeds_destroying_tilled_soil">Wild seeds destroying tilled soil</span></h2>
<p>A recent change adds "On Ginger Island" to the start of the sentence "On Ginger Island, growing seasonal wild seeds will often destroy the tilled soil (and fertilizer), leaving untilled soil in their place after harvest."  Is it not the case that this is true both on and off Ginger Island?  I'm pretty sure I remember seeing this happen with wild seeds on the main farm as well. <a href="../User_WedgeOfCheese.html?title=User:WedgeOfCheese&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:WedgeOfCheese (page does not exist)">WedgeOfCheese</a> (<a href="../User_talk_WedgeOfCheese.html?title=User_talk:WedgeOfCheese&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:WedgeOfCheese (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:12, 28 May 2022 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bombs_Pages">Bombs Pages</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../Bait.html" title="Bait">bait items</a> has a separate page and shares the same "Use" section, but the bombs only takes up one section of Crafting, and the same "Effects" section (if I'm not mistaken) is repeated three times in three pages? (Pages: <a href="../Bomb.html" title="Bomb">Bomb</a>, <a href="../Cherry_Bomb.html" title="Cherry Bomb">Cherry Bomb</a> and <a href="../Mega_Bomb.html" title="Mega Bomb">Mega Bomb</a>)
<br />Is it possible to consider optimizing it?

<p>This would need to be confirmed by other players as either a bug or something which is intentional but not explicit, but I couldn't craft the Geode Crusher and Farm Computer until I fully upgraded my farmhouse.
