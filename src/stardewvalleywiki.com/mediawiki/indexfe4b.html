{{Quote|Welcome to 'Livin' Off The Land'. We're back again with another tip for y'all. Now listen up:}}
'''Livin' Off The Land''' is a show that airs every Monday and Thursday on [[the Player]]'s [[Television|TV]]. It provides tips and tricks to new players to help them get acquainted with the game's mechanics.  

After two years, the host announces his retirement, and the episodes repeat.  Two of the tips are repeated within the two-year cycle.{{Clear|right}}

! Tip
|-
|1 Spring, Year 1
|This one's for all you greenhorns out there: chop [[wood]] and search for wild [[Foraging|forage]] to earn some cash while waiting on your first harvest!
|-
|4 Spring, Year 1
|This one's for you folks living in Stardew Valley. Check for [[Spring Onion]] southwest of town, where the river meets the ocean. You can sometimes find a whole bunch growing right out of the dirt.
|-
|8 Spring, Year 1
|Let's talk [[Crafting#Fences|fences]]. Fences are useful for keeping [[weeds]] at bay and protecting your [[crops]]. They also let farmers contain their [[Animals|livestock]]. Fences break down after a while, but [[stone]], [[Iron Ore|iron]], and [[hardwood]] fences last a lot longer than basic [[wood]]!
|-
|11 Spring, Year 1
|Woes from [[Animals#Crows|crows]]? Sounds like you need a [[scarecrow]]! Placing a [[scarecrow]] on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops!&lt;br />One more thing... need a bigger [[Tools#Other Tools|backpack]] to hold all your stuff? Check your local [[Pierre's General Store|general store]].
|-
|15 Spring, Year 1&lt;br />15 Spring, Year 2
|It's [[salmonberry]] season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash.
|-
|18 Spring, Year 1
|Ah, refreshing [[Weather|rain]]... a Farmer's best friend! When it rains, you don't have to water your crops. Use this to your advantage!
|-
|22 Spring, Year 1
|Get your hands on a [[Tools#Fishing Poles|fishin' pole]] and sell your catch! [[Fishing]] is a great way to make a little extra cash when you have some down time. The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of [[fish]] you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather!
|-
|25 Spring, Year 1
|[[Fruit Trees|Fruit trees]]. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!
|-
|1 Summer, Year 1
|[[Summer]]'s here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take [[hops]], for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck!
|-
|4 Summer, Year 1
|Here's a rundown of the [[fish]] you can only find in [[summer]]: [[Dorado]], found in forest rivers during the day. [[Rainbow Trout]], found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. [[Pufferfish]], found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And [[Octopus]], found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!
|-
|8 Summer, Year 1
|Let's talk [[corn]]. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both [[summer]] and [[fall]]. Now, get out there and plant some corn!
|-
|11 Summer, Year 1
|Starting tomorrow, an unusual amount of [[Foraging#The Beach|shells and corals]] are expected to wash up on beaches all around the world. I'm no scientist, but I've heard it's something to do with crab mating season. At any rate, you could make some good coin combing your local beach.
|-
|15 Summer, Year 1
|Got a [[spa]] in your town? Relax and hold still in the steaming hot water to replenish your [[energy]]. Ahh... feels good, don't it?
|-
|18 Summer, Year 1
|Summer's known for its lightning storms. If you know how to craft a [[Lightning Rod|lightning rod]], you can harvest the electricity and create [[Battery Pack|battery packs]]. These can be sold or used for [[crafting]]!
|-
|22 Summer, Year 1
|Most towns have a seasonal [[calendar]] in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well!
|-
|25 Summer, Year 1
|[[Fall]]'s almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new [[Crops|seeds]]. If you haven't upgraded your [[Watering Cans|watering can]] by now, it's probably a good idea.
|-
|1 Fall, Year 1	
|Let's talk [[sunflower]]s. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some [[Sunflower Seeds|seeds]] as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!
|-
|4 Fall, Year 1
|If you're a farmer in a small town, it's likely you'll be invited to create a "[[Stardew Valley Fair#Grange Display|grange display]]" at some point. Typically, a grange display consists of 9 items that best showcase your talents. Shoot for high quality, high value items and make sure to have a variety as well. [[Fish]], [[minerals]], [[Artisan Goods|artisan goods]], [[Fruits|fruit]], and [[Vegetables|vegetables]] are all good to have!
|-
|8 Fall, Year 1&lt;br />8 Fall, Year 2
|It's [[blackberry]] season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself!
|-
|11 Fall, Year 1
|Fish Focus: [[Salmon]]. Salmon return to their spawning ground in fall to lay eggs. That means the rivers are chock-full of them! You can only find them in fall, so get out there and cast your pole.
|-
|15 Fall, Year 1
|Got any [[Tapper|tappers]]? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. [[Maple Tree|Maple trees]] yield [[Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], [[Oak Tree|oak trees]] provide [[Oak Resin|resin]], and [[Pine Tree|pine trees]] produce [[Pine Tar|pine tar]]. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses!
|-
|18 Fall, Year 1
|[[Winter]]'s almost here. Make sure you're prepared to feed your [[animal]]s [[hay]] over the winter, because they don't like going outside in the cold. Also, your [[grass]] won't keep growing after that first frost. Each [[silo]] can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more!
|-
|22 Fall, Year 1
|[[Fish]] Focus: [[Walleye]]. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the [[fall]] and [[winter]]. It can be found in any freshwater location.
|-
|25 Fall, Year 1
|[[Winter]]'s coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a [[greenhouse]]. But there's still plenty to do! More next time.
|-
|1 Winter, Year 1
|[[Winter]]... A time when all the world goes quiet. Now's a great time to do some mining, fishing and gathering. Upgrade your tools in preparation for a productive spring. Or get your local carpenter to build something on your farm! Stock up on resources, upgrade, and prepare for the next year.
|-
|4 Winter, Year 1
|Wondering how to get your hands on '[[Refined Quartz]]'? Just put a regular old [[quartz]] in the furnace. You'll need a lump of [[coal]] to fuel the fire.
|-
|8 Winter, Year 1
|Find any tree seeds while chopping wood? You can plant those in the ground and a new tree will grow. Get creative!
|-
|11 Winter, Year 1
|There's a couple fish you can only find in winter... Squid and Lingcod. [[Squid]] can be caught from the ocean in the evening. [[Lingcod]] can be found in fresh water all day. Of course, there's rumors of extremely rare and unique fish that can only be found in particular seasons, but I don't have any information on them.
|-
|15 Winter, Year 1
|Let's talk geodes. [[Minerals#Geodes|Geodes]] are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A [[blacksmith]] can crack them open for you for a fee. Now, there's different kinds of geodes... and each one yields a different subset of [[minerals]]. The rare "[[Omni Geode|omni-geode]]", however, can contain every kind of mineral.
|-
|18 Winter, Year 1
|If you really want to make someone happy, give them their favorite [[Friendship#Gifts|gift]] on their [[Calendar|birthday]]! Trust me.
|-
|22 Winter, Year 1
|Ever see three [[Artifact Spot|little brown stems]] poking up out of the ground? They're hard to spot, sometimes. But if you dig on that spot, you'll always find something. Don't ask me how it works.
|-
|25 Winter, Year 1
|Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's [[Garbage Can|trash]]? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your [[friendship]]. Well, unless they're into the same thing.
|-
|1 Spring, Year 2
|Well, a new year has arrived. Keep your eyes peeled for any new kinds of [[Crops|seeds]] being stocked in your local general store. Hopefully you upgraded your [[tools]] during the [[winter]] and you're ready for a productive year!
|-
|4 Spring, Year 2
|[[Fish]] Focus: [[Eel]]. Eels can be caught from the ocean in the [[spring]] and [[fall]], during rainy evenings.
|-
|8 Spring, Year 2
|Got a kitchen? [[Cooking]] is a great way to enhance your abilities. Not only do they provide a convenient source of [[energy]], but many dishes temporarily [[Buffs|increase]] your [[skills]], [[speed]], and more! Smells good, don't it?
|-
|11 Spring, Year 2
|Item Spotlight: [[Crab Pot]]. Experienced anglers know how to craft crab pots. Despite the name, the pots can be used to catch a wide variety of aquatic critters, in both fresh and salt water. Just place your crab pot in the water and load with [[bait]]. Come back the next day and check on it to see what you caught. You'll need to load it with [[bait]] again to catch more.
|-
|18 Spring, Year 2
|Let's talk [[honey]]. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some [[flowers]] blooming near your [[Bee House|beehouse]] your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh?
|-
|22 Spring, Year 2
|Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when [[slimes]] are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe.
|-
|25 Spring, Year 2
|I'd like to talk about the famous [[Adventurer's Guild]] near [[Pelican Town]]. The guild leader, [[Marlon]], has a nice rewards program for anyone brave enough to slay monsters in the local caves. Adventurers will receive powerful items in exchange for slaying large quantities of monsters. There's a poster on the wall with more details. Very cool!
|-
|1 Summer, Year 2
|I've heard that some folks stand near moving [[Railroad|trains]] to gather any debris that falls off. Wow... the things people will do for a freebie!
|-
|4 Summer, Year 2
|Animal Spotlight: [[Pig]].

In these parts, pigs are trained to sniff out valuable [[truffle]]s. You've got to let the porkers outside and be patient... they'll work their magic when they're good and ready. Make [[Truffle Oil|oil]] out of the truffles to maximize your profit.
|-
|8 Summer, Year 2
|Here's a reminder of the [[fish]] you can only find in [[summer]]: [[Dorado]], found in forest rivers during the day. [[Rainbow Trout]], found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. [[Pufferfish]], found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And [[Octopus]], found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!
|-
|11 Summer, Year 2
|Fish Focus: [[Super Cucumber]]. You can find this rare fish in the ocean. It only comes out in the evening, during summer and fall.
|-
|15 Summer, Year 2
|I know it's hard... but stop worrying so much about your [[Animals#Horse|horse]]! You can leave them anywhere and they'll make their way back home. They're very smart and independent animals!
|-
|18 Summer, Year 2
|Here's an idea... start a wild [[Trees|tree]] orchard! Put [[Tapper|tappers]] on those trees and harvest the valuable syrup. Or don't! See if I care.
|-
|22 Summer, Year 2
|Item Spotlight: [[Keg]]. The classic use of a keg is to make [[wine]] out of [[grape]]s. But did you know you can make wine out of any [[Fruits|fruit]]? Yep.&lt;br />You can also make [[juice]] out of veggies.
|-
|25 Summer, Year 2
|Do you have a journal? Don't forget to check it from time to time. It's easy to forget that you've written something important down.
|-
|1 Fall, Year 2
|If you managed to get your hands on a '[[Rare Seed|rare seed]]', now's the time to plant it. Although it's said to take all season to grow, reliable sources have told me it actually takes just 24 days. The end result is rumored to be the [[Sweet Gem Berry|sweetest fruit]] in the entire world.
|-
|4 Fall, Year 2
|Some farmers have reported [[Crops#Giant Crops|strange things]] happening when large fields of [[cauliflower]], [[melon]], or [[pumpkin]] reach maturity. Hmmm. I can't verify it, myself.
|-
|11 Fall, Year 2
|Looking to get [[Marriage|married]]? You're going to need a [[Mermaid's Pendant]]. Everyone this side of the Gem Sea knows what it means when you give them a Mermaid's Pendant.&lt;br />Getting your hands on such a pendant can be tricky.
