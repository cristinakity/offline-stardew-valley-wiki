{{Quote|Greetings! It is I, the queen of sauce... here to teach you a new mouth-watering recipe from my secret cookbook. This week's dish...}}
'''The Queen of Sauce''' is a [[Television|television]] channel which teaches the player [[Cooking|cooking]] recipes. Beginning on Spring 7, a new recipe airs each Sunday for the first 2 years of the game. On Wednesdays a random recipe that aired on a previous Sunday airs as a "Re-run". During reruns, recipes which are not known to all players are prioritized. Simply watching the channel will teach the player the recipe if it's not yet known. The rotation of Sunday recipes repeats on a 2-year schedule with 32 recipes in total.

The player may also read the [[Queen Of Sauce Cookbook]] instead of watching the channel to learn all 32 recipes immediately.

|[[File:Stir Fry.png|center]] 
|[[Stir Fry]]
|Stir Fry! It's a perfect way to get some healthy greens on your plate. Sautee the greens in a little sesame oil and make sure to add plenty of fresh ginger and garlic. Now breathe deeply... Oh, that's good.

|[[Coleslaw]]
|Coleslaw! Envisioning bland mounds of limp cabbage? You're not alone. But a great coleslaw can be so much more. Make sure you have [[Red Cabbage|juicy fresh cabbage]] for this one. Toss with a little [[vinegar]] and [[mayonnaise]] and you're all set. Ah, that's crisp.

|[[Radish Salad]]
|Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery [[radish]]. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...

|[[Baked Fish]]
|Baked Fish! Whenever I make this one at home, my two cats go bananas. I need a second chef around just to keep them from hopping on the counter for a bite! Just make sure the fish is fresh, preferably caught with your own rod! Now watch as I place the fish on a bed of spring greens...

|[[Bread]]
|Bread! Breadmaking can be a very complex form of art, but I'll make it simple for you. The most important ingredient is [[Wheat Flour|flour]], of course. But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and a little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!

|[[Roasted Hazelnuts]]
|Roasted Hazelnuts! I've got a nice old [[hazelnut]] tree behind my house, and every year I invite the family over for a nut roasting party! Once we start roasting, it's inevitable that the neighbors will show up. That rich, nutty smell is irresistible. Now, here's the family recipe...

|[[Fruit Salad]]
|Fruit Salad! Here's a healthy and delicious treat to brighten up your day. The most important thing to remember is that you need ripe fruit. Forget the bland stuff they sell at the supermarket... I'm talking fresh-picked, juicy, bursting-with-flavor fruit. Okay, now watch closely...

|[[Blackberry Cobbler]]
|Blackberry Cobbler! This one always reminds me of Stardew Valley. There's a few days in fall where the valley is overflowing with the most delicious [[Blackberry|blackberries]] I've ever tasted. If you can get your hands on some, I'd highly recommend them for this simple cobbler.

|[[Crab Cakes]]
|Crab Cakes! [[Crab]] meat is very flimsy on its own, but mixing it with bread crumbs and egg is a great way to give them some body. That's why these cakes are my favorite way to eat crab! But before you go cracking any shells, stay tuned for my essential seasoning mixture...

|[[Fiddlehead Risotto]]
|Fiddlehead Risotto! [[Fiddlehead Fern|Fiddlehead ferns]] are beautiful, but actually quite bland on their own. That's why you have to pay careful attention to the spices you add. I'll be honest, it's not very easy to make a good fiddlehead risotto. But with my help, you'll have the best chance at achieving it.

|[[Poppyseed Muffin]]
|Poppyseed Muffin! [[Poppy|Poppies]] make beautiful ornamental flowers... but why not make full use of the plant with these delightful muffins? I'm a huge fan of poppy seeds. They're subtle, but they add a nice flavor and a great texture to bready desserts. And they're healthy!

|[[Lobster Bisque]]
|Lobster Bisque! You could serve this one to the [[Governor|governor]] himself. It's rich, creamy and delicious, with just the right amount of oceanic flavor. The hardest part is finding some [[lobster]], but I'm sure you can do it. Heck, if you're feeling crafty you could catch one yourself with a [[Crab Pot|crab pot]]!

|[[Bruschetta]]
|Bruschetta! It's a wonderfully simple appetizer that really showcases the quality of the ingredients. You'll need [[bread]], [[tomato]], and [[oil]]. First, you'll need to grill the bread. Slice the tomato and place onto the grilled bread. Then drizzle with oil and serve. I told you it was simple!
