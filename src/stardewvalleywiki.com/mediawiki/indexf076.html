{{Quote|Greetings! It is I, the queen of sauce... here to teach you a new mouth-watering recipe from my secret cookbook. This week's dish...}}
'''The Queen of Sauce''' is a [[Television|television]] channel which teaches the player [[Cooking|cooking]] recipes. Beginning on Spring 7, a new recipe airs each Sunday for the first 2 years of the game. On Wednesdays a random recipe that aired on a previous Sunday airs as a "Re-run". During reruns, recipes which are not known to all players are prioritized. Simply watching the channel will teach the player the recipe if it's not yet known. The rotation of Sunday recipes repeats on a 2-year schedule with 32 recipes in total.

The player may also read the [[Queen Of Sauce Cookbook]] instead of watching the channel to learn all 32 recipes immediately.

|[[File:Stir Fry.png|center]] 
|[[Stir Fry]]
|Stir Fry! It's a perfect way to get some healthy greens on your plate. Sautee the greens in a little sesame oil and make sure to add plenty of fresh ginger and garlic. Now breathe deeply... Oh, that's good.

|Coleslaw! Envisioning bland mounds of limp cabbage? You're not alone. But a great coleslaw can be so much more. Make sure you have [[Red Cabbage|juicy fresh cabbage]] for this one. Toss with a little [[vinegar]] and [[mayonnaise]] and you're all set. Ah, that's crisp.

|Radish Salad! There's nothing like a fresh, peppery [[radish]]. It reminds me of the late spring... my mother would slice up our fresh radishes and serve them on grainy bread with a little salt and pepper. Ah, those were the days... but I digress. Now, watch closely...

|[[Baked Fish]]
|Baked Fish! Whenever I make this one at home, my two cats go bananas. I need a second chef around just to keep them from hopping on the counter for a bite! Just make sure the fish is fresh, preferably caught with your own rod! Now watch as I place the fish on a bed of spring greens...

|[[Bread]]
|Bread! Breadmaking can be a very complex form of art, but I'll make it simple for you. The most important ingredient is [[Wheat Flour|flour]], of course. But before we create the dough we'll need to activate our yeast. They prefer warm water and a little something to feed on. I use plain sugar, but honey or maple syrup will do!
