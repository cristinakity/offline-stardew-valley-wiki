:''"Parrots" redirects here. For the parrot found in Pelican Town, see [[Emily#Four Hearts|Emily's 4-heart event]].

'''Golden Walnuts''' are the currency of the parrots on [[Ginger Island]]. The number of Golden Walnuts that a player has saved is displayed directly underneath [[the Player]]'s name in the [[Skills]] Tab. Walnuts are shared amongst players in [[Multiplayer]].

The player can find a total of 130 Golden Walnuts scattered on the island by exploration, killing monsters, farming, fishing, mining, breaking crates in the [[Volcano Dungeon]], etc.

After finding 100 Golden Walnuts:
* [[Qi's Walnut Room]] is unlocked.
* Players may purchase the [[Queen Of Sauce Cookbook]] from the [[Bookseller]].
* The [[Giant Stump|Raccoon]] may reward the player with a random unshipped item other than [[Roe]] and [[Artisan Goods]] starting with their sixth request.

==Parrot Hints==
Interacting with the parrot in Leo's hut will cause it to squawk hints for more walnut locations. Hints update as the player progresses—quantities change to reflect only unfound walnuts, and hints to walnuts that have already been found no longer appear.

*''Fire mountain... Hidden down fire river...''
*''Buried near bones...''
*''Help man in tent...''
*''[Quantity] buried in the north...''
*''[Quantity] buried in the west...''
*''[Quantity] buried in the south...''
*''[Quantity] hidden in the north...''
*''[Quantity] hidden in the west...''
*''Bulging very close by...''
*''Stripey slimes to the west...''
*''[Quantity] stuck in shelly stones by shore...''
*''[Quantity] grow on the farm to the west...''
*''[Quantity] deep in the water...''
*''[Quantity] hidden in fire mountain treasures...''
*''[Quantity] encased in fire mountain gadgets...''
*''[Quantity] nutty stone in fire mountain...''
*''[Quantity] taken by monsters in fire mountain...''
*''Hidden in the pages of the journal...''
*''[Quantity] buried... Pirate's cove...''
*''Bathing in the heart of the star...''
*''Atop fire mountain...''
*''Kribbit... Gurrrp...''
*''Hidden shrine in rain forest...''
*''Inside hard, gold thing...''

|Harvesting
|Each crop harvested on the Ginger Island farm, either by hand or with an [[Iridium Scythe]], have a 5% chance of yielding a Golden Walnut, up to a total of 5. Only crops that do not regrow and do not require a Scythe to harvest will give Golden Walnuts.&lt;ref name="harvestconditions" />

|Puzzle
|After the farmhouse is repaired, the player may talk to the [[Ginger Island#Gourmand Frog|Gourmand Frog]]. The frog then asks the player to grow a [[Melon]], a [[Wheat]], and a [[Garlic]], in that order. When a crop is mature, leave it unharvested and talk to the frog again to show him the crop. The reward is 5 golden walnuts per crop. Harvest each crop after receiving its reward. The three crops yield a total of 15 walnuts.&lt;br /> 

&lt;i>Note: All three crops may be planted at any time, together or separately, but they must be presented to the frog in order one at a time and each crop can be harvested only after the frog has seen it and rewarded the player.&lt;/i>

==Golden Joja Parrot==
{{Spoiler}}
[[File:Golden Joja Parrot.jpg|thumb|The Golden Joja Parrot]]

The Golden Joja Parrot can be paid gold to find all remaining Golden Walnuts the player has not found. It is located to the west of the volcano. It costs {{Price|10000}} per unfound nut. The player is warned that doing this will prevent the player from having the true Ginger Island Experience. 

All remaining walnuts will be added after the player goes to sleep for the night.
 
==Notes==
*The parrot in Leo's hut provides [[#Parrot Hints|hints]] for 123 out of 130 walnut locations with the exception of: 
**1 on the southern bush in the Gem Birds shrine area
**3 for placing a [[banana]] on the altar in the east, by the staircase to [[Leo]]'s hut
**up to 3 rewarded for winning the [[Darts|Darts Game]].
*If all of the walnuts associated with a hint are found on the same day that the hint was given, the parrot will remain silent for the rest of the day and will not give another hint until the next day.
*When calculating Golden Walnuts needed to enter [[Qi's Walnut Room]], the first Golden Walnut found is not counted, meaning the player must actually find 101 Golden Walnuts in total before unlocking the room.

==Bugs==
*Occasionally, the game may miscount the number of Golden Walnuts obtained, leaving the count at 129/130, when all walnuts have actually been found.  The workaround is to open a chat window (with &lt;code>?&lt;/code> or &lt;code>T&lt;/code> on PC) and enter &lt;samp>/recountnuts&lt;/samp>.
*If the player has purchased all upgrades on [[Ginger Island]] for 116 Golden Walnuts, and has traded the rest for [[Qi Gem]]s, they can use the chat window command &lt;samp>/recountnuts&lt;/samp> to receive Golden Walnuts in the amount above 116 that they had earned before trading nuts for gems. This can be done infinitely, by trading all nuts for gems and then using the chat command.
*Occasionally, the golden walnut north of the entrance to Qi’s Walnut Room may fly off screen when shaken (like a [[Garbage Can]] lid exploding, but without the sound) and not be counted as collected, making [[Perfection]] impossible. The only workaround is to ask the Golden Joja Parrot to find the walnut.
