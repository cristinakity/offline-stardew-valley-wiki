Where do we put info about wood, stone, etc? Like how to get them.. There's no item page that seems to fit Resources. Make one under the Gameplay heading that is called Resources and fill it in.

Many pages are listing the sale price of items as "Profit" which is misleading.  I might suggest "Revenue" for accuracy.  Others are using "Price" which may also be more clear.

Can you please add [[Spa]] to "The Valley", thanks~ --[[User:Katiee|Katiee]] ([[User talk:Katiee|talk]]) 03:17, 28 February 2016 (EST)

== hi ,i want to access  the wiki's api ==

i am a Stardew Valley player,and also i good at Android programming,so i want to buidl an app in Android, and put the wiki's content into the app,so can you give me this website's api? and the app is free.

== desert mines should be added on front page ==

a page about the desert mines should be added on the front page. the desert mine is what you unlock with the skull key.
I think that should qualify as a spoiler or have an accessed content warning due it's secret nature. Or are we just presenting all data because that's what wikis do?

|- I think it would be great to have a spoiler alert stuff for the wiki but it might not be very plausible since a wiki is just a spoiler website. Haha! It's pretty difficult to un-spoilize a wiki. xD --[[User:AColonUlcer|AColonUlcer]] ([[User talk:AColonUlcer|talk]]) 8:11, 07 March 2016 (PST)(AK)

I completely agree with putting it on the front page. It's a major area in the game; it should be listed with the others. I was about to do it myself, but the front page is locked. I was thinking of using the iridium node sprite as the icon for it, as Skull Cavern is pretty much the only place you'll see them. [[User:Hammy2211|Hammy2211]] ([[User talk:Hammy2211|talk]]) 08:36, 13 May 2016 (EDT)

:Scratch that; I realized that the template is the part that gets edited. I've added a link with the iridium node as the icon. Personally, I think it came out well. [[User:Hammy2211|Hammy2211]] ([[User talk:Hammy2211|talk]]) 10:45, 19 May 2016 (EDT)

== Children ==
I cant find anything on the wiki about having children while you can have 2 if you get a nursery.
Maybe put it on the marriage page?

We need a page detailing Heart Events. I started a table for Maru's.

==Dialogue==

Is it worth me adding dialogue spoken by NPCs to their respective wiki pages?

== Add reddit to the links in the main page ==

Well, seing that the reddit community is so thriving, it would be nice to add it to the main page of the wiki. --[[User:Frenchiveruti|Frenchiveruti]] ([[User talk:Frenchiveruti|talk]]) 14:42, 5 March 2016 (EST)

== Frontpage Icon for Social ==

As the Frontpage Icons got edited in the last days I'd suggest the speech bubble icon your Cursor gets when hovering over a Villager for Social. (thanks to TownEater for pointing out to post here) - [[User:Xores|Xores]] ([[User talk:Xores|talk]]) 20:40, 5 March 2016 (EST)

== Void Egg ==

Does Marnie seriously sell you void eggs?  I bought mine from the witch that appears randomly to the south of the farm, so I added it. And someone changed it to Marnie. Is that legit? I will try to see, but I don't think that it's true. I wanted some confirmation before I changed it back if it wasn't true.

== Error Item ==

I saw, that in article [[Version History]] in v. 1.01 the following words had been added: "'Error item' should no longer appear for sale in the Saloon". But 10 or more minutes ago I bought a bread with name ''Error Item'' (in the Saloon). It's a bug again? [http://www.pixic.ru/i/H0y1t0Y1h394f6p8.jpg Screenshot.]

== Standard Schedule layout ==

It Would be great to get a standard setup for Schedules. At the moment we have around 3 possabilities. [[Leah#Schedule|Leah]], [[Alex#Schedule|Alex]] and [[Caroline#Schedule|Caroline]].

I would have to say the [[Caroline]] table is much better then the others. --[[User:AColonUlcer|AColonUlcer]] ([[User talk:AColonUlcer|talk]] 16:22, 8 March 2016 (PST)
::I personally don't like Leah's. I think it would be nice to have a sort of hybrid of the other two. Problems with Alex's table:
::*It's sortable, a schedule doesn't need to be sortable.
::*All the days are expanded at all times.
::*This table doesn't actually state the location by itself like Caroline's does.
::Problems with Caroline's table:
::*It has an outline like most collapsibles do, it could do without it and still look nice.
::*There's no limit defined to the width of the table, so like right now, if you go to her page, open spring friday, you see how all the days, opened or not, change in size? That needs to be modified.
::*Even though it has separate sections, it doesn't have separate headers.
:: :File:Wiki Discussion Schedule Tables.png|Here is an example of what I want and don't want. Look at the top portion for now. Monday and Tuesday are an example of what happens when you keep the current format but remove the outline, it becomes are misaligned like that. Wednesday and Thursday are an example of what happens if you do the same as the other two days but you also set the table's width, that's a lot better but still not quite what I want. Friday looks like a combination of Alex's and Caroline's method. The line where the day is in Alex's page is turned into a collapsible with a width set of 500px, and text is aligned to the left so when you expand it the Friday doesn't move towards the center (like how Spring moves to the center on Alex's page now, which I think is okay for seasons but don't think is appropriate for individual days), and the table itself is set to a width of 100% so it encompasses the full amount of space allotted by the Friday collapsible. Now look at the middle portion, those are what my edits look like on Caroline's page. What do you guys think? Also this is unrelated but take a look the bottom section. Can we please not put these extra spaces before and after everything? It's very annoying and serves no purpose. You could argue the spaces before it could have a purpose but the ones after just get in your way when you're trying to edit. -- [[User:Kapra|Kapra]] ([[User talk:Kapra|talk]]) 03:39, 9 March 2016 (EST)

To be honest i am a little confused here. You are right a timetable does not need to be sortable. Do we have to say "Time" and "Location" isn't it self explanatory? So why not a Collapsible table with the day over 3 Columns and a set width? like
{|class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:600px"
!colspan="3"|Friday
|-
|9:00 PM
|[[Museum]]

With or without the round border is a minor detail. but i for one am a friend of that white Text on top of the green because it is well readable and looks nice. The set width is a great idea, [[User:Kapra|Kapra]], because it adds clear lines/structure to the site when all tables are the same width. Should we set a vote or something? - [[User:Findas88|Findas88]] ([[User talk:Findas88|talk]]) 21:51, 11 March 2016 (EST)
::::I don't know, I just think it looks nicer if the collapsible isn't colored in and left-aligned (you have it center-aligned when expanded in your first example), and you're right on the columns' types being self explanatory. I preferred it the way I put it but if we had it your way I wouldn't complain because that does look nice. I don't know how things are decided here, how would we vote? Do we suggest ideas to admins or some authority?

== Centralized Items ==

It looks to me like there's the same data being duplicated all over the site.  Small example is [[Trash]] &amp; [[Recycling_Machine]] contain some of the same information for Production of Recylcing.  If that ever changes it needs to be changed in multiple places and i'm sure this is happening in a lot more places.  What's standard practice for wikis?  My thought would be to store the recycle output in the Recycling Machine page and then have some indicator/link from Trash page to get to that page?

-[[User:LokiPoki|LokiPoki]] ([[User talk:LokiPoki|talk]]) 13:43, 11 March 2016 (EST)

:For Trash and Recycling one could just edit Trash and make it a redirect page to Recycling Machine just like http://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Void_Spirits&amp;redirect=no - [[User:Xores|Xores]] ([[User talk:Xores|talk]]) 14:08, 11 March 2016 (EST)

::I am currently working on centralizing items and am awaiting on the heads up or heads down if an array wiki extention will work. Even if it doesn't, I should still be able to make something like this. Check out [[User:Kapra|my user page]] for what I have so far. Aditional information that is hard to find in data, or data that users want to add, should be easy to manually override and going to the data pages to edit them should show a table of instructions on how to edit them. -- [[User:Kapra|Kapra]] ([[User talk:Kapra|talk]]) 17:27, 11 March 2016 (EST)

== "requests" page? ==

Hi, this started with a search for movement information (sand vs paths vs horse, etc) but it has since broadened. Is there a "topic request" or "unanswered questions" page? If not, should there be? Currently open questions seem to only be located on the talk page of the related topic, and these are easily lost as the wiki grows.

(And does anyone know how the different surfaces impact movement speed? Is a crystal path faster than a wood path?)  [[User:Manning|Manning]] ([[User talk:Manning|talk]]) 21:29, 4 May 2016 (EDT)

== Changed Game Files - Game not Loading. ==

Hello everyone!

I have recently run into a problem, I decided to install a mod http://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/299/?.
This mod allows you to add a bathroom extension to the 2nd upgrade of the house.
When I was adding the mod to the game files, it said would you like to replace these files? stupidly, I clicked yes.

When I opened the game, the game would crash after I try to load my character, so far the only possible way out of this problem that I see is to completely reinstall the game and start fresh without the installed mod, but then I would lose my save file (Year 2, Summer) that I have been working very hard to achieve.

If anyone has any ideas or advice on how to fix this problem I would love to hear it :)

Thanks a bunch,

== Cooking page seriously borked ==

Kamyk2000 August 04 2016 7:47 P.M. Est

(I originally posted this to the site maintenance page because I couldn't figure out how to add it to this one until just now.)

Sorry if I'm doing this wrong, I couldn't find any other page to report this, or even how to add a new post to a pre-existing page. When I go to the cooking/recipes page http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cooking it shows nothing but a page full of garbage characters like these "�����c��b�"�W:�z��m��(;�}'� ��]|�F����Ռ���". The entire page is nothing but those kinds of characters.

The page needs to be rolled back or repaired.

I apologize if there is some more immediate or appropriate way to report this, but I couldn't find one.

Edit: Apparently this also is the case with the gourmet chef page: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Gourmet_Chef

and the travelling cart page: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Travelling_Cart

(I'm going to keep looking so hopefully there wont' be more but I'm guessing someone deliberately mucked up quite a number of pages at this point)

The page for wallpapers: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wallpaper

Flooring: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Flooring

Crops: http://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crops

That appears to be all borked pages from the main contents page plus gourmet chef but I have no clue how many sub-pages like gourmet chef might be messed up too.

Hey, I'm looking to learn about editing content on wikis and I'd like to start with contributing to adding 1.1 content to existing pages or creating this. Apologies if this is in the wrong section. Also my username is QuantumBlink.

:Your contributions are more then welcome! A big chunk of the new content is in (thank to to [[User:Katzeus]]), but if you see something missing, incorrect or in need of better formatting, suit yourself. The worst that can happen is having someone revert or modify your edit. Feel free to leave a message on my talk page if you need help about anything.

== March 22st (?) ==

Hi all,

though this is the first thing I've actually added/edited on the SV Wiki, I've been a long time user. I noticed on the home page there is the latest version box, and something that was bugging me for a bit is that it says "March 22st" instead of "22nd". Bit of a nit-pick, but even so. (it also makes me chuckle a little bit tbh.) I've attached a link to a picture. -> [http://prntscr.com/ep62th]

Thanks!

== Spa align edit ==

Kind of ironic as this is under another nit-picky thing, but I noticed that on the home page under the locations for "The Valley", the Spa location is not following the aligned pattern of the other locations.

Cheers!

== Capitalization standard ==

What is the preference regarding the capitalization of in-game entities? For example, on each of the [[Seasons|season]] pages, references to the surrounding seasons are lowercased, except for in the [[winter]] article, in which they are cased as proper nouns. This inconsistency also exists elsewhere, including references to time (e.g., Noon versus noon). [[User:Whtqn|Whtqn]] ([[User talk:Whtqn|talk]]) 19:44, 2 November 2017 (UTC)

:The only rule is that links need to match page names, so if the page name is capitalized, but you want it in lower-case in the body of a page, then use the format &lt;code>&lt;nowiki>[[Pagename|display name]]&lt;/nowiki>&lt;/code>.  Out of laziness, I often leave the link as is, so it's capitalized even when it really shouldn't be.  (I also tend to capitalize names of seasons, even though that's not correct.)  As long as the link is correct, then it's your choice.  With literally hundreds of editors over the past year and a half, there's bound to be a lot of differences.  No worries.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:52, 2 November 2017 (UTC)

::Think the mediawiki software is case INsensitive on the first letter, so that e.g. [[Spring]] and [[spring]] should go to the same page. Won't help for [[Axes|Copper Axe]] and copper axe though (as highlighted by the 'redlink'). Could use heaps of redirects, but not the most fun thing to set up. Presumably capitalisation is not a big problem. [[User:Pangaea|Pangaea]] ([[User talk:Pangaea|talk]]) 05:34, 25 March 2018 (BST)

== New Banner ==

What's with the new gray banner at the top of the Wiki pages? No content except a tiny spot containing a link. At first I thought it was an editing error, but it's been quite a few days now. The link is to an itunes / Stardew Valley app for sale. Is the Wiki doing ads now? [[User:Butterbur|Butterbur]] ([[User talk:Butterbur|talk]]) 21:51, 24 November 2018 (UTC)
:There's a new box on the page, but it's not supposed to look like a gray dot.  It's below the Stardew Valley logo, and above the list of current versions of the game.  (On widescreens, the two are side-by-side).
:Remember a while back when you were having performance issues, and I told you to install adblockPlus?  The wiki has always had advertisements at the very top of the page, and in the left sidebar.

:I'm not sure if it should. Since the Tesla version is something that comes with purchasing a Tesla, but it's not available otherwise, it's much more difficult to crowd-source information about it. I know that it launched with some version of 1.4, but I haven't heard which or if it's received 1.4.5 or not.

== Merch Link in Resources ==

I hadn't thought about it before, but it doesn't make much sense to have an official merchandise link in the Resources section alongside upload.farm and the planner. There's a link to merchandise in the wiki sidebar, so removing it from this area wouldn't remove it from the site entirely.
