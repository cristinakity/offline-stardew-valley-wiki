{{Quote|Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons.  But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Haley''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives in [[Pelican Town]]. She's one of the twelve characters available to [[marriage|marry]].

==Schedule==
After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on [[Ginger Island]] is unlocked, Haley may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Haley will immediately go home to bed. Haley never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or her checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Shown below are Haley's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season. For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}

Since her ten-heart event also triggers at her home, the two events will happen together.
{{#lst:Bouquet|girls}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger = '''Part 1:''' Enter [[Pelican Town|town]] between 8am and 3pm on a day that's not raining.&lt;br />'''Part 2:''' At least one day later, enter the Farm House between 6:20am and 5pm.&lt;br />'''Part 3:''' At least one day later, enter Pelican Town with a [[Chocolate Cake]] in inventory between 6am and 3pm on a day that's not raining.
 |details = '''Part 1:'''&lt;br />On her way to [[2 Willow Lane|her house]], Haley overhears a conversation between Vincent, Jas, and Penny. Jas complains about her math book cover falling off, and Penny notices that all her books are falling apart. Penny says "new books are expensive, so we'll just have to make do with what we have..." Vincent asks "Does this mean I don't have to do my homework?" Talking to Haley after the scene will result in her saying: "I've been thinking about cake a lot lately...".

'''Part 2:'''

Haley says she wants to get everyone together for a charity cake-walk in town on the next sunny day, and explains that it's kind of like [[wikipedia:Musical chairs|musical chairs]] but everyone gets cake. She asks the player to bring a [[Chocolate Cake]].
*{{Choice|Yes|0}}
Haley replies "Great! I'll meet you in the town square tomorrow, weather permitting."
*{{Choice|Yes (begrudgingly)|0}}
Haley replies "What's up with the snarky attitude? Fine. You're going to show up tomorrow with a chocolate cake, or else you're [[wiktionary:in the doghouse|in the dog house]]. You like that better?"

Haley says she's bringing [[Pink Cake]], and the "Haley's Cake-Walk" quest is added to the Journal.

'''Part 3:'''

Most of the villagers are gathered in the town square, with Jas, Vincent, Pam, Emily, Caroline, Marnie, Jodi, and Clint participating in the cakewalk. After the player delivers the chocolate cake to Haley, she stops the cakewalk and begins to distribute the prizes, with Pam receiving the player's cake.

After all the prizes have been given, Haley reveals that she overheard Penny's conversation, and held the cakewalk to raise money for new books. Penny is grateful to both Haley and the player for their kindness. Jas is excited and Vincent is crestfallen at the prospect of new books.  Robin then tries to convince Lewis to lower their business tax since education is being funded without tax money, and Pierre joins her against a shocked Lewis.
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Haley will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, she will add her own room to the right of the bedroom. She'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where she'll sometimes go to take pictures.

On rainy mornings, Haley may offer you something sweet for breakfast:  [[Cookie]], [[Blueberry Tart]], [[Pancakes]], [[Poppyseed Muffin]], or [[Maple Bar]].  On mornings when Haley stays inside the farmhouse all day, she may offer you [[Fried Egg]], [[Omelet]], [[Hashbrowns]], [[Pancakes]], or [[Bread]] for breakfast.  On rainy nights she may offer you dinner:  [[Chowder]], [[Eggplant Parmesan]], [[Bean Hotpot]], or [[Parsnip Soup]].

==Timeline==
Haley's look evolved over the years the game was in development.
Here's a timeline showing how ConcernedApe's art and Haley's style changed over the years before the game was launched.
[[File:Haley Timeline.png|center]]

==Trivia==
* Even though Haley's ten heart scene is all about her dark room, a new dark room is not included in her added room after marriage.
[[File:Seasonsgreetings3.png|200px|thumb|right|Screenshot from [https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-13/ Dev Update 13 referencing peppermint coffee]]]
* In the "[[Pink Cake|pink cake]]" episode of "[[The Queen of Sauce]]" (the 21st of Summer, Year 2), The Queen says, "A viewer from Pelican Town wrote to me recently... let's see... Her name's Haley. She wrote, 'I tried your pink cake last time I was in [[Setting#Zuzu City|Zuzu City]] and I fell in love with it. Could you share the recipe on your next episode?'. Well, why not? It's a marvelous cake. And you'll never guess the secret ingredient... melon!"
* On Wednesdays in Winter, Haley may say "I wish someone would bring me a peppermint coffee. Don't even bother, I know you won't be able to make one."  This may lead players to believe that Peppermint Coffee is available, and is one of Haley's loved or liked gifts.  In fact, Peppermint Coffee cannot be crafted, cooked, or brewed, and is not available in-game anywhere.  In early game development, Haley would say "The only thing I like about winter is peppermint coffee... hey, are you even listening?"
* In the 8-heart event, if the player is wearing a Prismatic [[Tailoring|clothing item]], it can be seen animated on the pictures, even though pictures are normally static.
* In the 8-heart event, Haley's outfit changes in the photographs to her pre-release outfit. For some reason the sprites were never updated to her final design.
* In a note on the tabletop next to the fridge there is a letter to Haley and Emily from their parents saying "We just left the Fern Islands last night, after staying for two months."
