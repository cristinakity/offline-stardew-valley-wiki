<p>Besides these, I want to know why the talk pages, user_talk pages and user pages are not transfered to this site? Does every user have to copy their old pages manually?

<dl><dd>Hello Horizon!  I created the pages for #1, but you may have to mark the pages in the Main namespace for deletion (I searched for them but didn't find them, maybe you will have better luck!)</dd>
<dd><a href="../User_ColitoCole.html" title="User:ColitoCole">ColitoCole</a> will have to give your bot the appropriate group rights, I don't seem to have that ability.</dd>
<dd>Cole and I are discussing how to handle the help page.  It might go in the left sidebar instead of on the main page.  It might need to be rewritten also.  Unfortunately, I have to ask for your patience on that one.</dd>
<dd>User talk pages have to be moved manually, yes.  Your old talk page is here:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../external.html?link=https://zh.stardewcommunitywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98">https://zh.stardewcommunitywiki.com/User_talk:Horizon98</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Website_Malfunction_Database_Problem">Website Malfunction Database Problem</span></h2>
<p>For the last 2 or 3 days certain wiki pages keep malfunctioning, displaying an error instead of the expected page.
It was just happening again about an hour ago, but of course I can't replicate the problem right now when I want to copy/paste the exact error.
The error says something about the database not working. It does seem to be pages that might want to load data which are affected (like specific item pages, eg. sap or oyster), so that makes sense. When it starts happening, it generally keeps happening and refreshing the page a few minutes later or trying a different item does not work.
</p><p>If it happens again I'll try to edit this (first time user, but I assume I can edit... I'll "rtfm" later) with the error details. I'm fairly new to Stardew Valley and am referencing this site a _lot_... do you want me to keep updating this to let you know when it's down (or "PM" someone or something?). If this is a common occurrence for you and there's a big red "Restart Database" button you have somewhere that you press when it messes up, I would be willing to press it for you whenever I see that error start happening if that would be useful for you. Thank you for your great and useful wiki! <a href="../User_Maxxie.html?title=User:Maxxie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Maxxie (page does not exist)">Maxxie</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Maxxie.html?title=User_talk:Maxxie&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Maxxie (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:07, 28 February 2021 (UTC)

Maybe changing the sitename in other languages to <code>"&lt;translated name of the game&gt; + &lt;translated name of wiki&gt;"</code> or <code>"Stardew Valley Wiki | &lt;translated name of the game&gt; + &lt;translated name of wiki&gt;"</code> has better SEO performence in search engines. <a href="../User_Horizon98.html" title="User:Horizon98">Horizon98</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Horizon98.html" title="User talk:Horizon98">talk</a>) 12:24, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

<dl><dd>It might be possible to create the kinds of tables you describe, but they would have to be manually copied to up to 11 other languages, for each page where they're used.

If there's anything I can do to help work towards that kind of goal, I'm willing to help a lot with it, as there's not really a better idea to work around the languages that come to mind.

<dl><dd>I'm not sure how languages work in MediaWiki exactly since I only work English game wikis, and this question/suggestion doesn't help at all with wanting an API, but would DynamicPageLlist3 extension ever be enabled on this wiki for the creation of automated data tables? We (another game wiki--standalone MW install) use it for pulling infobox template parameter values of pages in certain categories into dynamic data tables that we can then format via surrogate templates, perform parser functions on per line, etc to create sortable, self-updating data tables... so say, to compile a table of all farmed foods: their name, cost, sewing time, season, profit etc (whatever common parameter names and values are contained in their common templates for a given category can be pulled into a table, formatted, calculated/parsed with necessary icons etc and made sortable). There are many creative uses for DPL3, including random images, galleries, data tables etc. Perhaps then only the words used in the DPL statement to generate a table on a given page need changing. When I view an other language page, it looks like a separate and distinct page with separate and distinct categories, so it would seem like a DPL statement required to call a data table would be easily adapted to the different languages.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>DPL3 is now maintained by a dev over at Miraheze wiki farm (they have a large user base so should be stable enough). It does not make or require database changes (no need to run update script via SSH) like Cargo does, and thus can be activated and deactivated easily without long-term consequence or maintenance burden, though it is more limited (and functional richness should intentionally be limited to 4, not 5 its full functional richness). It seems to work fine with special characters and other languages (I think), though there are some resource expensive functions that should be avoided, its ability to create self-updating, aggregated data tables from infobox parameter values is exceptionally nice if one can't do a full solution like Cargo. I have used DPL3 a fair bit, so am curious if this was considered in lieu of cargo. Or if they would consider installing it for examples/testing. If they were, I'd be happy to help out with examples on how to use it, since its documentation isn't ideal.

<dl><dd>A year since this was discussed, but figured I'd pipe up with an opinion. I've converted a couple of large wikis to use Cargo, on Gamepedia wikis (before it was killed off/eaten), and it was quite honestly a monumental task. Ideally it's something you plan for from the get-go, so for a wiki like this, which is kinda "complete" or very mature, it's not something I would really recommend. There are also benefits with a "static" wiki. Admittedly more troublesome when many things change, because you can't change a value one place (db) and then all pages are automatically updated. But in this case that is unlikely to become an issue, and a benefit with static pages (from my brief looks) is that you don't run into the potential issue of pages "breaking" due to issues with the database, or duplicate values/rows and suchlike, which at least was a problem with Cargo in the past. <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 13:50, 1 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>You could create a section called "Time" on the <a href="../Multiplayer.html" title="Multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> page, under "Features", that could include detailed info about /pause.

<p>I've noticed in some places the term "farm maps" is used and in other places the term "farm layout" is used (which is more accurate, and is descriptive of what a user finds since the layouts are not maps). A redirect I created from "Farms" (to accommodate for the term choice I see as confusing) to Farm Maps was deleted. To my knowledge, there is only one actual map in the game and the wiki pages are usually based on proper game terms. The map tab in user settings has way-finding markings/labels on it--that to me is a map. I added the "Farms" redirect because as a new user, I'd never search "Farm Maps" for different farms or farm  <i>layouts</i>. I tend to think it would be nice to help other new users with redirects for some common sense terms (the deletion of this redirect did not make good sense, its logic was sound). Does anyone go through the server logs regularly to determine which terms are most searched for (not including autocomplete partial results) that don't have pages and/or redirects, in order to help new users, and use this to create those redirects supported by some access log data? This would probably be very helpful and is fairly common. To be fair, it may be difficult for experienced wiki users already familiar with existing page titles, to be impartial as to what a new user would consider to be a helpful or needed redirect. In my opinion, that’s what fresh eyes can be good for sometimes. Perhaps you won't agree though, and that's fine.&#160;:)
</p><p>Also, is there a style guide somewhere off-wiki? I notice that proper titles/terms for game items are sometimes capitalized and other times not, which does this wiki prefer? Even just a line about this on the guide page can add a very helpful thing for less experienced editors to pitch in on to help. Some wikis create a checklist of these consistency items that users find very helpful. Might be a nice addition?

<dl><dd>Okay, now valid spoiler tags are being removed also, though the help editing page still says to add them (sorry but this is confusing for users attempting to help). Perhaps you could elaborate there on when and when not to add these, or remove that text if you no longer want content marked as spoiler? Maybe the 1.5 update for mobile might drop sooner than I think and perhaps this is the reason, if so that makes sense. The edit reversal comment said someone has to remove them all one day, as the reason for reversal. There is an easy way to determine and do that when the time comes by adding a parser function to the spoiler template that auto-categorizes (temporarily) any page that uses that template to its update number... then edit each page to remove them all (90% were already done before I came along, I'd have been happy to do it when the time comes, though seems like I may have outstayed my helpfulness here), then remove the parser function that auto-categorizes when done. Half pages spoilered and half not was very confusing for me as a new player. I think you guys are wanting less editing help than I thought, wanting to do most of it yourselves, understandable. Cheers.</dd>

<p>Before I exit for good, I wanted to add a potentially helpful suggestion, since I saw some atmosphere discussion elsewhere. There is an excellent extension for promoting goodwill and a positive atmosphere on a wiki, it is called <b><a class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Thanks">Thanks</a></b> (it requires the Echo extension, which is also <b>very</b> useful to users, providing enhanced notifications). The <b>Thanks</b> extension allows both users and admins to give thanks and show appreciation for efforts on helpful edits. Such an extension could help to offset the tone of hurried, "brief, or blunt" (quoting Cole) admin actions, by supplementing it with some highly positive and appreciative ones that are a quick, easy click while reviewing changes/diffs. Having such a feature is a great way to help foster a community atmosphere, and I'd imagine it is why it is used on Wikimedia/Wikipedia projects. I install both on the wikis I work on, as I find it has a very beneficial effect on atmosphere.

<p>If you search for a page using the built-in search engine, you need to type in the exact title of the article, with all but the first letter being case-sensitive. So for example, if you search for "qi gem", you won't be sent to <a href="../Qi_Gem.html" title="Qi Gem">Qi Gem</a>, because the "G" in the title is capitalized (the "Q" can be uppercase or lowercase). Similarly, you can link to <a href="../Qi_Gem.html" title="Qi Gem">Qi Gem</a> and <a href="../Qi_Gem.html" title="Qi Gem">qi Gem</a> but not Qi gem or qi gem. <br />
This is a technical limitation in the MediaWiki software. Wikipedia (en.wikipedia.org) gets around it by making redirects for any reasonable variant of a page title people might search for. That might seem a little clunky, and indeed, the English Wikipedia has millions of redirects as a result, but it's good enough for them, and they're one of the top-ten websites in the world. <br />
I couldn't find anything definitive on whether or not we want redirects for alternative spellings and capitalization, just a few comments from last year on the old wiki. <br />

<dl><dd>Hi Monika! Unfortunately, I can't give you any advice about editing unofficial wikis. Several unofficial wikis for Stardew Valley exist, including wikis in languages that have official wikis. You have to decide for yourself if you want to get involved with them. Use your best judgement, and good luck to you! <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:16, 3 January 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="New_Mail_Page?"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Mail_Page.3F">New Mail Page?</span></h2>
<p>I was recently trying to see all of the items that villagers could send you in the mail and realized there was no centralized page for mail. I was able to find the info I needed by going through each villager, but I think having a centralized "Mail" page could be helpful for a number of reasons. This page would include basic info about the mail system, as well as info on what letters you can receive, what triggers them, etc. This would include quest letters, letters from mom and dad, villager gifts, etc. Most of this info is available on some page on the wiki, but it's not organized super well. I can create the page and populate out much of it, but before I went through the effort I wanted to make sure that creating a page for this would be okay and my work wasn't going to just get undone. Also, the Help Editing page isn't super clear about the guidelines on adding a page, so I'm not sure when it is appropriate to create a new page or not. <a href="../User_Squigs44.html?title=User:Squigs44&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Squigs44 (page does not exist)">Squigs44</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Squigs44.html?title=User_talk:Squigs44&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Squigs44 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:38, 9 February 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi Squigs! Discussion before making large changes is always a good idea. Regarding a "Mail" page -- to be honest, it sounds like a <i>lot</i> of duplication of info. A disambiguation page might be more appropriate. What info about the mail system in general do you think is missing from the wiki? Is this something that can be summarized on <a href="../Collections.html#Letters" title="Collections">Collections#Letters</a>? <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:45, 9 February 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I don't think it's the fact that info is missing from the wiki that is the problem, but more of the fact that you have to actually search even deeper than just a mail page to get information regarding a specific mail. It would also be good for new &amp; developing players to know exactly what kind of mail they can expect to get, otherwise they will only be able to look up the ones that they already got. Now that I think about it, I think having a "cutscenes" page would also be nice, or at least putting all of the cutscenes in the pages for the locations it takes place in. <a href="../User_User314159.html" title="User:User314159">User314159</a> (<a href="../User_talk_User314159.html" title="User talk:User314159">talk</a>) 21:57, 9 February 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, a lot of mail information is present on the wiki already. However, this information is spread across at least 40 or 50 different pages, sometimes as a one sentence entry as part of a large page. Trying to find that information right now requires you to know exactly what you are looking for. Some of the letters are briefly mentioned, but don't include the actual text of the letter, so that information is missing. There are a few letters that I couldn't find on the wiki, such as the letter that informs you that you will be "featured in next week's 'up &amp; coming' column of the Stardew Valley Tribune!" as one example. So the main thing would be consolidating information from 40+ pages into one spot, but also we would have a nice spot to add in new information that is not present. It could also feature a trivia section about letters present in the game code that were never implemented (there is a letter about stardew hero rankings that was never implemented, along with a few others). I don't think the collections section on letters would be a good spot for all of this. There are already several places on the wiki where information is duplicated across pages - for example, I can read about Robin liking Hardwood on the Friendship Page, on Robins Page, and on the Hardwood Page. We have that information in multiple places because people might search Robin wanting to know what gifts they need, or they might search Hardwood wanting to know what uses it has. Likewise, I think having a landing spot for people searching about mail might be beneficial. Ultimately I will do whatever the admins want, but personally I think a mail page would add value to the wiki. <a href="../User_Squigs44.html?title=User:Squigs44&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Squigs44 (page does not exist)">Squigs44</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Squigs44.html?title=User_talk:Squigs44&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Squigs44 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:07, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hi Squigs - I don't disagree with everything you said, but I was asking a specific question ("What info about the mail system in general do you think is missing from the wiki") that you haven't answered.</dd>
<dd>Why don't you create a mockup in your user space, and see how the project goes. Feel out the scope of it, what information you'd like it to have, and how it might be organized. Then we can better assess exactly what we're dealing with, rather than discussing in the abstract.</dd>
<dd>Just by the by, if you search for "stardew valley tribune", the only search result is <a href="../Gold.html" title="Gold">Gold</a>, where you can find the text of the letter you mentioned. Good luck! <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:27, 10 February 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>No, no, a thousand times no. I'm sorry, I think "worst page.." is harsh as well, but so is George. Right now, the format matches the other templates, and I don't want that to change. Any text changes also have to be translated into 11 other languages. And, the template isn't meant to be around for any length of time, it shouldn't be seen for more than a day unless I have the flu or a broken leg.</dd>

<dl><dd>A couple of things -- couldn't this be achieved more easily with the <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> tag? Also, the links should be blue when hovering, not red.

<dl><dd>I could use the map tag, but it has a few problems 1. you can't use percentages with it so the link position dosen't change with the image size. 2. I'm not sure how to make the box appear with the map tag 3. it would be about the same amount of code.</dd>
<dd>You are right about the color of the links, i'll make then blue.

<dl><dd>The template would be useful for the Template:infobox location, allowing user to click on the map instead of typing the name of a location to find info about it.</dd>
<dd>the links on the map could be enabled only for the infobox using a template parameter (like links=1).

<dl><dd>No one should have to type to find the location of a building that uses Infobox location, there should be a link in the "Address" field or the body of the page. If there isn't, we can fix that. I'm sorry, you did some impressive css work, really, but I don't think the benefits outweigh the number of changes that would have to be made across all 12 languages. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:08, 29 June 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Last time I try to convince you, if you find this change not worth it I understand it and I'll stop.</dd>
<dd>I think you misunderstood me when I said that you can find a location without typing. I meant that you can click the map to see any other location that the one referenced by the infobox. For example if you are in page for the Mines you can easily click the map to go to the page for the farmhouse.</dd>
<dd>The number of changes to be made are 36, three per language, one on Template:Map/styles.css that would require just copying the CSS I wrote, one on Template:Map that would require translating the links of the locations, and one on Template:infobox_location to enable the links on the map. If the changes are done in this order no page will break and the links would be rolled out to the whole wiki.</dd>
<dd>If you give me the go ahead I will translate the links for all the wikis and then I can make the change in a couple of hours. <a href="../User_Samu698.html" title="User:Samu698">Samu698</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Samu698.html" title="User talk:Samu698">talk</a>) 21:00, 29 June 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Still no, I'm afraid. There has been a request in the past, however, to add links to the large images on the <a href="../Cindersap_Forest.html" title="Cindersap Forest">Cindersap Forest</a> and <a href="../Pelican_Town.html" title="Pelican Town">Pelican Town</a> pages. Would you be interested in that project? These would be new templates that would replace the images currently on the page.

<p>I created a new topic because the previous one was getting too indented&#160;:]. As you requested I created the Pelican town map template.
This is a temporary version with the links shown, to make it work as intended it requires some <a href="../User_Samu698/Sandbox/Template_Pelican_Town_Map.html" title="User:Samu698/Sandbox/Template Pelican Town Map">CSS</a> in a styles.css page that doesn't work in the sandbox due to content model problems. <a href="../User_Samu698.html" title="User:Samu698">Samu698</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Samu698.html" title="User talk:Samu698">talk</a>) 11:15, 4 July 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Very nice! Go ahead and create the template as <a href="../Template_Pelican_Town_Map.html" title="Template:Pelican Town Map">Template:Pelican Town Map</a>, and we can iron out the CSS problems in the template namespace. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:04, 4 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ok, I added the template for the English wiki it seems to work, if there are any problems tell me in my talk page. Also it could be useful to add text telling about the links, but it would require a bit more CSS and extra translation work. <a href="../User_Samu698.html" title="User:Samu698">Samu698</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Samu698.html" title="User talk:Samu698">talk</a>) 15:04, 4 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I don't think It will be added but I'm working on a feature for the Governor bot in the stardew disc, and it technically scra*es (spam filter, replace with a "p") the wiki - if it gets added it probably won't be used too much but are you all ok with that?

<dl><dd>Hello AnotherPillow! I've forwarded your question to <a href="../User_ColitoCole.html" title="User:ColitoCole">Cole</a> and the server people.

<dl><dd>Thanks! The wiki doesn't have any sort of Rest API for getting info that's inside of tables does it?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Infobox_switching">Infobox switching</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I am new to the wiki. I wanted to ask if there is a function to have different versions of pages/infoboxes. For reference, this is a thing on the OSRS wiki. A good example is Hat of the Eye (on OSRS . wiki) , where players can select between the different colors by using the tabs on top of the infobox.
</p><p>I was thinking this would be useful for tools, to account for their upgraded forms in one article.
</p><p>If it is not possible, is there anyone interested in implementing it? I wouldn't know how, but if someone could point me to some documentation I'd be willing to take a look and try to learn.
</p><p>Thanks, <a href="../User_Termades.html?title=User:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Termades (page does not exist)">Termades</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Termades.html?title=User_talk:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Termades (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:00, 6 September 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Unfortunately, tabbed sections require an extension this wiki doesn't have installed. So, it's not possible at this time. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:00, 6 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Who has control over our installed extensions? Would that be something that the wiki community thinks is worth installing? From working on OSRS wiki, I can vouch for its usefulness. <a href="../User_Termades.html?title=User:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Termades (page does not exist)">Termades</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Termades.html?title=User_talk:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Termades (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:40, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I have actually brought it up with the other admin before, seeing it used on other wikis. But we decided that the changes to 12 languages wouldn't outweigh the benefits. If the wiki were new, the chance that we would decide to install the extension might be higher, but after 6 years and 12 languages, I don't see this as something we'll be installing. Perhaps it will be appropriate for the Haunted Chocolatier wiki, whenever that comes around. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:47, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Is it Tabber you speak of, or has there come something better in the last couple years? Also, while browsing the <i>Versions</i> special page I noticed that Scribunto is installed. Don't know how to use it myself, but from experience on other wikis, it was incredibly powerful. You (Termades) could perhaps try to play around with it and see what you come up with? <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 10:13, 9 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Domain_Name_and_visibility">Domain Name and visibility</span></h2>
<p>I am not sure on the "corporate structure" of the wiki, any funding sources, or our total budget. However, I would like to propose the following, with that in mind.
</p><p>I think the wiki would benefit from moving to "stardewvalley .wiki" instead of the current "stardewvalleywiki .com" address. Ideally, we could also register "sv .wiki" as well for a short link.
This would be more in line with other top fan wikis, and since it seems we arent using wiki .gg or Fandom, we should have control over our domain.
</p><p>Again, obviously I am not in a position to know of any problems that might be in the way of such a move, but I would like to put it out there for discussion.
</p><p>Thanks, <a href="../User_Termades.html?title=User:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Termades (page does not exist)">Termades</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Termades.html?title=User_talk:Termades&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Termades (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:48, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>ConcernedApe has sole control over the domain name. At this point, moving the URL would require redirects in 12 languages, so I don't see it as likely. You can contact him, but I wouldn't expect a response. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:50, 7 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
