==Mermaid Code==
Hi I just wanted to add that the pattern for the mermaid thing to get the pearl is wrong - it is actually 1-4-5-3-2. Just wanted to share as I spent some time in game trying the same code and wondering why it wasn't working üòÖ [[User:Wildeyes1|Wildeyes1]] ([[User talk:Wildeyes1|talk]]) 18:02, 15 March 2021 (UTC)
:This looks like a bug on your side. I can confirm the code ''is'' 1-5-4-2-3 on PC (Steam 1.4.4, 1.4.5 and 1.5.4). [[User:IBugOne|IBugOne]] ([[User talk:IBugOne|talk]]) 19:22, 15 March 2021 (UTC)
::I can confirm, the code for me was 1-4-5-3-2. I also have the Steam version, so this is quite peculiar. [[User:CantyCanadian|CantyCanadian]] ([[User talk:CantyCanadian|talk]]) 18:26, 31 October 2021 (UTC)
:::If you can report the bug on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/ official forums], that would be great. Include the version number on Steam (if you've opted into the 1.5.5 beta branch or not), and what the Secret Note said (if it said 15423 or 14532). Any other relevant details would be helpful to the devs in tracking down the source of the bug. Thanks so much, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:22, 31 October 2021 (UTC)

== Bug in Multiplayer ==
I tested the Bug described in the the last note and I didn't get locked. The Player just took the fishing rod out of the water.
Computer (nonSteam/GOG), 1.5.4, Multiplayer with 2 Players. Could anyone else test it? For me it seems like an outdated/wrong info. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 19:02, 14 May 2021 (UTC)
:I've removed the bug from the page.  ConcernedApe tried to remove ''all'' fishing rod bugs with v1.5, so it's probably been fixed.  Thank you for testing this and commenting so we could remove the outdated info! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:15, 14 May 2021 (UTC)

== Available From ==

Last edit objected to. Do you not see that "available from" does not mean the same thing? It does not say exactly *what* is available. The "what" here is the ability to begin the ride, not the ability to fish. It misleads and confuses the following text that describes the exiting phase.

Consistency in wording is fine as long as it does the job. But words are not "one size fits all". Consistency of wording does not guarantee uniformity of meaning. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 16:08, 4 April 2022 (UTC)
:I see your point, the ride is actually available from 5pm to 2am, providing you enter the boat before 11pm. I'll adjust the text. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:26, 4 April 2022 (UTC)

== Bridge being broken at the [[The Beach]] ==

When it comes to us playing the game, The wooden bridge going to the rockpools is not broken, but we saw on other people's playthroughs in multiplayer that the bridge was broken. We think it was a bug that needed to be fixed, but we're not sure because the wiki does not say so. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:04, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
:I don't play multiplayer, so I'm not sure, but you have to check the dates of youtube videos to see which version people are playing. There may be a different default map used for multiplayer than for single-player as well. perhaps someone else has some insight. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:55, 13 July 2022 (UTC)
::In single player, I just played through night market, and the bridge was indeed still in repair. I even crossed it. Not that it makes much difference, for during night market, it is not possible to collect forage from the beach. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 00:20, 16 July 2022 (UTC)

== Bug ==

I'm letting you know that I've found the bug in a video called "Deep Sea Fishing" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL5wwBKdktA (Cut to 9:46.) It was episode 59 of a Stardew let's play. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 7:56, 23 July 2022 (UTC)
:Hello 9000! The game's developers don't monitor the wiki for bug reports; you must report them on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports-non-modded.12/ official forums]. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:45, 23 July 2022 (UTC)

== Mermaid Show Gif image ==

Since we have text for the Mermaid Show, would it make sense if we uploaded a Gif image of the Mermaid Show for the page? because I feel a bit empty without this image because I want people to know what it is. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:22, 11 September 2022 (UTC)
:In a word, no. We had images of all the attractions, and the page was incredibly cluttered. There's no point in adding an image of one attraction without the others. And there's also no point in spoiling the mermaid show for people who haven't seen it. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:31, 11 September 2022 (UTC)

== Octopus caught on submarine ==

While running through a new game, I caught an octopus while on the submarine. It seems to be a rare catch, but I am unaware of the percentages or when it was added to the potential catches. [[User:Mra2pz|Mra2pz]] ([[User talk:Mra2pz|talk]]) 17:29, 1 December 2022 (UTC)
:Hi Mra2pz! That info is already on the page, see [[Night_Market#Fishing_Submarine]]. It's a fairly rare event, so congratulations! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:07, 1 December 2022 (UTC)

== Deep Sea Fishing Probability ==

It seems what's listed is wrong, based on what I've been catching. specifically; I caught only 8 fish (2 midnight squid, 1 blobfish, 2 spookfish, 3 super cucumbers, but i know that's not a great sample size) but 16 seaweed. am i just a trash magnet?? [[User:3eveeLuv|3eveeLuv]] ([[User talk:3eveeLuv|talk]]) 04:41, 5 February 2023 (UTC)

== Villager paths at [[The Beach]] ==

Since of us playing on the Xbox, when we put objects where the [[Villagers]] walk to the location to where they stand and give out scripted dialogue, on [[Winter]] 18, if an object was placed on a [[Villagers|Villager]] walking tile, the object gets destroyed as if they were walking through an object anywhere else. This happens because the Night Market map replaces [[The Beach]] map on [[Winter]] 15, 16, and 17, and it acts like if objects were placed on walking tiles if the Night Market wasn't happening. We were trying to put [[Sign Of The Vessel]]s next to the Warp Totem location before [[Winter]] 15, and [[Leo]] and [[Linus]] destroyed them. They didn't give out an Angry dialogue bubble over their heads, it just vanished on [[Winter]] 18. We think that this might mean that we need an image of the Night Market map of [[Villagers|Villager]] paths being empty slots, with [[Rotten Plant]] slots indicating where objects are safe to place without them getting destroyed. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:36, 24 April 2023 (UTC)

Just letting you know that right now we uploaded an image covering most of the Night Market map, we couldn't find an image of the whole map but it being shown on the page was the closest one we could find on the Internet via Google. We're also gonna let you decide if we should add it to the page or not. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 9:50, 24 April 2023 (UTC)
:I appreciate the effort, but you're going to have to find someone with a device that can use the [[Options#Screenshots|Screenshot]] feature in the game to get a full image of the map, after the villagers have walked through it. The image you uploaded is incomplete (as you know), and the quality is very poor. 
:For now, I will add a note to the [[Crafting]] page about the Night Market. Be aware that things may change with v1.6 also... 
:Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:25, 24 April 2023 (UTC)

== Not being able to complete [[Willy]]'s [[Bug Meat]] Quest during the Night Market ==

On the [[Quests#List of Special Orders|Special Orders Board]], you can pick up [[Quests]] from [[Villagers]], and you can collect rewards if you complete them, like a recipe to make [[Fiber Seeds]], a [[Sewing Machine]], a recipe to make [[Solar Panel]]s, etc. The reward for completing this Quest is the recipe to make [[Quality Bobber]]s. But you complete this Quest on [[The Beach]], but when the Night Market is happening, the bin where you put the 100 [[Bug Meat]]s in next to the [[Fish Shop]] is not there during the Night Market, meaning it is impossible to complete this Quest. I've extended the blurb about [[Willy]]'s [[Bug Meat]] Quest line, if that is fine. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 07:59, 27 January 2024 (UTC)
:You are the victim of bad timing. Version 1.6 may or may not change that behavior. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:17, 27 January 2024 (UTC)
