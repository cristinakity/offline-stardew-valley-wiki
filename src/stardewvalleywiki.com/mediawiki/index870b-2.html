== Shane's schedule ==
It looks like Shane's schedule on Saturday for both unrestored and restored Community Center are the same. Should they be combined for simplicity? Also, Shane's schedule on Sunday for the restored Community Center seems to be missing. Is it the same as the one for the unrestored Community Center?--[[User:Spaceeinstein|Spaceeinstein]] ([[User talk:Spaceeinstein|talk]]) 03:47, 8 March 2021 (UTC)
:In looking at the data file &lt;samp>Characters\schedules\Shane.xnb&lt;/samp>, it appears that he should go to Pierre's on Saturday and not Sunday.  So, the page may be incorrect (I don't know which season you're referring to, or all of them?), but updating schedules is a project no one has seemed to want to take on, or finish.  So, most of the characters' schedules have some missing info, or incorrect info.  There's no point in combining the schedules if they're inaccurate, really.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:10, 8 March 2021 (UTC)

== Shane's 6 heart event ==

I don't think that Shane's 6 heart event matches the one that is on this page. I'ts mostly the same, but with no dialogue choices and Shane's dialogue is shorter. Maybe I accidentally skipped part of it but I don't think I did. [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 18:12, 13 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva
:I just ran through the heart event in a test save, and it was the same as shown on the page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:49, 13 April 2021 (UTC)

::I might have just accidentally skipped some of it then [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 18:12, 13 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva

:::After playing this cutscene on Nintendo Switch, Shane does not seem to appear anywhere on his schedule. Is there an altered schedule for the first day of this event? [[User:SilverThyme2045|Silver (based)]] ([[User talk:SilverThyme2045|talk]]) 21:25, 8 October 2023 (UTC)
::::No, there is no schedule in which Shane is supposed to disappear after a heart event, but it could be a bug. Please report bugs on [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/ the official forums] for investigation! Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:52, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

== Shane's Birthday after marriage ==

Gave Shane a birthday beer when he is my spouse and the hated gifts dialogue appeared. Patch 1.5. [[User:Tahlrix]] 1:15, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
:Did you also lose hearts? You should get about 3 hearts when gifting him a beer on his birthday (depending by Quality). Do you use any mods? He definitly loves beer. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 12:37, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
::Please report bugs on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/ official forums].  There was a bug that caused NPCs to give the incorrect response to gifts, but it was reported to have been fixed in v1.4.  Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:28, 21 July 2021 (UTC)

== Shane and jas ==

I’m sorry but Jas is Shane’s godchild and niece [[User:Stardewemmi|Stardewemmi]] ([[User talk:Stardewemmi|talk]]) 21:14, 7 June 2022 (UTC)

:Can't be his niece. If Marnie is the aunt of both of them, then they must be cousins, otherwise if they were siblings it would ''definitely'' have been mentioned. [[User:Quartia|Quartia]] ([[User talk:Quartia|talk]]) 17:35, 30 August 2023 (UTC)

== Scene fading out ==
I was a bit suspicious that the wiki used to say the scene fades out did not really make sense to me, because in the game the screen pans to the northwest and then fades darker. And that is what made me make this change. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 8:49, 14 July 2022 (UTC)

Idk  [[User:Nugget|Nugget]] ([[User talk:Nugget|talk]]) 17:18, 23 January 2023 (UTC)

== Shane's marriage schedule ==

I think he should go outside some more ngl [[User:Nugget|Nugget]] ([[User talk:Nugget|talk]]) 05:50, 23 January 2023 (UTC)

== 8-heart Event Trigger ==

It seems that I am unable to trigger the 8-heart event at present, though I do have 8 hearts with him. Could it be because I haven't yet seen his 6-heart event and its follow-on? I know it doesn't work that way with most heart events and other NPCs, but there is something reasonable about this particular possibility in that it reflects the story line much better. And since it also triggers the availability of Blue Chickens, perhaps it's done to ensure full development of the story line before that can happen. If I'm right, shouldn't there be a disclaimer in the article? [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 18:23, 14 July 2023 (UTC)
:Right you are! Technically you have to have seen the follow-up to his 6-heart event, the next-day visit at the farmhouse door, to trigger the 8-heart event. I'll adjust the article. Thanks for pointing this out! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:42, 14 July 2023 (UTC)

== Green rain ==

During green rain, Shane continues a semi-regular schedule and when found in the Saloon says something along the lines of: 'Oh there's a weird weather event? Hadn't noticed'. The page just states that he stays in Marnie's all day, which needs to be edited.

:The Green Rain schedule on this page refers to the first time there is green rain, when nearly everyone stays inside the entire day. After the first year, everyone defaults to their usual rainy day schedule. 

:Since I've only had the chance to test this on new saves, I can't confirm whether the "stay inside all day" schedule only applies to ''Year 1'' or to the first year the player ''encounters'' green rain, or how best to handle that distinction if it exists. For that reason, I've put off changing all the villager schedule edits I made to specify that the unique green rain schedule applies to year 1 only. 

:Of course, it is possible that I just didn't pay enough attention to Shane and missed him going to the Saloon the first year.
