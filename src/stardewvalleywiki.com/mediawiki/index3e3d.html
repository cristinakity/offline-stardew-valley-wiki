== Prices ==

Should the price column even be there for this store? The price is randomized for each instance of the item in the list each day the cart is present.[[User:Metalax|Metalax]] ([[User talk:Metalax|talk]]) 04:38, 5 March 2016 (EST)

*I think it's a good idea for the price to be there. At least to give people an idea of how much money they might need for the item.  --[[User:AColonUlcer|AColonUlcer]] ([[User talk:AColonUlcer|talk]]) 12:18 09 March 2016, (PST)

:: 2 columns (min price and max price) would better represent the price range and would be useful for sorting.
:: The price range for "non-furniture" is &lt;code>(max(100, 3 * base_price), max(1000, 5 * base_price))&lt;/code>, while the price range of "furniture" is &lt;code>(250, 2500)&lt;/code>. --[[User:BryghtShadow|BryghtShadow]] ([[User talk:BryghtShadow|talk]]) 23:41, 11 May 2016 (EDT)
:::I'm working on updating my template to use these formulas but the fruits tree saplings doesn't seem to obey the same formula. Any idea how the price range of theses is calculated? --[[User:Vg-tal|Vg-tal]] ([[User talk:Vg-tal|talk]]) 22:12, 9 October 2016 (BST)
:::: The formula for Traveling Cart is still the same in 1.1.1, but Pierre seems to sell saplings at &lt;code>base_price * 4&lt;/code>. Using the base_price from objectInformation:

:Thank the page have been updated, the 3 last items without automatic calculation are the generic jelly, the generic pickles and oil of garlic (I don't know their base price). there's also the rarecrow, but I think he's at a fixed 4,000g like the rare seeds at 600/1000g. Anything else that might be wrong is a error in the base price I entered. --[[User:Vg-tal|Vg-tal]] ([[User talk:Vg-tal|talk]]) 19:40, 10 October 2016 (BST)
:: [[Jellies and Pickles|Jelly]] is 160 base, [[Jellies and Pickles|Pickles]] is 100 base, and [[Oil of Garlic]] is 1000 base. The regular Rare Seeds that can appear during any season are 200 base (range 600-1000). The bonus Rare Seed is fixed at 1000g (100% chance during spring/summer; 0% chance otherwise). Rarecrow (40% chance to appear during fall/winter; 0% chance otherwise) is fixed at 4000 price. The bonus stuff might be worth noting somewhere on page. --[[User:BryghtShadow|BryghtShadow]] ([[User talk:BryghtShadow|talk]]) 20:29, 10 October 2016 (BST)

== Item Rarity ==

I know this would be quite the undertaking, but do you think it would be worthwhile to try to accumulate some statistics? 
I'd like to know the relative rarity of items. I ran into the Wallflower Pal furniture item today, for instance. No mention of it on the site anywhere. Is it a 1/1000 or rarer on visits to the Traveling Cart? [[User:Danben428|Danben428]] ([[User talk:Danben428|talk]]) 21:36, 15 March 2016 (EDT)
: I'm not too good with probabilities. But here are the numbers:
:* Do the following 10 times:
:** Pick a random number ''n'' in the range [2,790). ''n = ((n + 1) mod 790)'' until it is valid (i.e. the id exists, is not blacklisted, and is not a quest item and not named "Weeds", etc).
:** Pick a random number ''a'' in the range [1,11). Pick a random number ''b'' in the range [3,6). Let ''price'' be ''maximum (a * 100, b * base_price)''.
:** Randomly choose the stack count (5 stack is 10% chance, 1 stack is 90% chance).
:* Pick a number ''m'' in the range [0,1613). If ''m'' is not valid id or is blacklisted, re-roll. &lt;small>There are 145 valid furniture, each with equal chance to appear.&lt;/small>
:* During spring/summer, Rare Seed is guaranteed at 1000g, with 10% chance for 5 stacks and 90% chance for 1 stack. During fall/winter, there's a 40% chance for Rarecrow (4 of 8) to be sold at 4000g.
:* Additionally during the year, there's a 25% for 1 Coffee Bean to be sold at 2500g.

I don't know how frequency % other than 1.26 got to appear on the page for non-furniture items (other than rarecrow/coffee bean/rare seed), but I've corrected this error.

Tulips may have appeared 92 times in the empirical test done to produce the table above, but that by no means indicates that tulips will appear 92 times more often than any other item.  It's (pseudo-)random.  All (roughly) 790 items have an equal chance of appearing.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 01:37, 11 March 2017 (UTC)

Update:  I see what you did; anytime an artifact is rolled, the game increments the index until it finds a valid object # ''without'' re-rolling a random item #.  I was assuming the game calculated a new random #.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:00, 11 March 2017 (UTC)

&lt;strike>I just added about 10-15 items that were missing from the tables.  I didn't calculate the frequency % for all those items; if anyone else wants to step in and do so (based on the table above), PLEASE!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 02:37, 11 March 2017 (UTC)&lt;/strike>

All items are updated.  The list of items and %'s is complete for all other than furniture.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 04:11, 11 March 2017 (UTC)
The furniture list is now updated and complete as of v1.11 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:52, 13 April 2017 (BST)

Are you sure about the iridium sprinkler? Because I saw it once being sold by the travelling cart [[User:Black Kitty Rii|Black Kitty Rii]] ([[User talk:Black Kitty Rii|talk]]) 09:05, 5 September 2016 (EDT)

: My post was true for 1.07. Iridium Sprinklers definitely existed pre-1.07. I'll have a look at the 1.1.1 stock. --[[User:BryghtShadow|BryghtShadow]] ([[User talk:BryghtShadow|talk]]) 20:47, 9 October 2016 (BST)

== Item descriptions == 

Do we need need them on this page? By removing the descriptions and putting multiple items per lines, we can cut the length of the page by a good amount. I've been working on a new layout on my userpage and plan on making the switch once it's ready if nobody object. --[[User:Vg-tal|Vg-tal]] ([[User talk:Vg-tal|talk]]) 00:04, 21 September 2016 (BST)

== Cart inventory predictions based on save ID ==

I'm in the process of creating a utility that projects cart inventories when provided with a save ID, one that could ultimately provide value on this page.

For the first week, I've correctly projected 12 of the 20 random non-furniture items (5 on Friday, 7 on Sunday) and their prices/quantities, but the other 8 are pulling item IDs that are one eligible ID short of what I'm seeing in game (e.g. pulling 636 "Peach" in my utility instead of 637 "Pomegranate" in game). I can only think of 2 reasons why this might be: 
*I'm missing a rule in the code that is incrementing the itemID in these cases. None of the items being skipped in my test (e.g. Peach, Quality Sprinkler, Pomegranate Sapling, Rainbow Shell, Cranberry Sauce) appear to be ineligible.
*I'm not generating exactly the same random numbers as the game even though we're using the same seed, maybe due to different .NET framework versions? I find this unlikely because I'll match on items 2,5,7,9,10 and not 1,3,4,6,8, for instance.  
--[[User:Nark|Nark]] ([[User talk:Nark|talk]]) 10:42, 14 February 2018 (EST)


:It seems obvious now, but ALL item IDs being produced by my model need a 1 added to them before incrementing until they hit an eligible item regardless of whether the initial random represented an eligible item or not. If I make this change, I successfully replicate all 20 first week random non-furniture items and their prices/quantities.
:I don't really see where this is happening in the code, maybe someone can enlighten me?
:--[[User:Nark|Nark]] ([[User talk:Nark|talk]]) 12:30, 14 February 2018 (EST)

::I'm an idiot, the do-while loop is executed one time before the conditional expression is evaluated, a 1 will be added to the initial random once no matter what.

:::Mouseypounds has done some work with RNG and predictions here:  https://mouseypounds.github.io/stardew-predictor/
:::To be honest, I'm not sure how we would incorporate the data into the wiki, since all game IDs are random.  It seems like more of an interactive thing, where the user would have to input his/her specific game ID before getting any meaningful data.  But, maybe you can enlighten me.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:29, 14 February 2018 (UTC)
::::Thanks for the link, I'll test it later tonight. You're exactly right though, a link to an external interactive utility is exactly what I had in mind. If Mouseypounds' utility is reliable, I think users of this page would find value in being provided a link to it, I know I would've.
::::--[[User:Nark|Nark]] ([[User talk:Nark|talk]]) 15:54, 14 February 2018 (EST)
:::::I agree, if you get your utility working reasonably accurately, we can add a link to it on the page.
:::::Unfortunately, it seems Mouseypounds has abandoned his/her work in "alpha tesing" state, and I have no idea how reliable it is.  The big red disclaimer text saying "I expect this not to work very well" on the webpage itself prevented me from adding it to the wiki... --[[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:02, 15 February 2018 (UTC)
::::::So I checked out Mouseypounds' utility and while it does appear effective for predicting the mushroom floor in my testing thusfar, it doesn't appear to provide predictions for traveling cart inventories. I've verified the accuracy of my utility in a number of save files and will be working to create a GUI for it in the coming couple of weeks.
::::::--[[User:Nark|Nark]] ([[User talk:Nark|talk]]) 23:41, 15 February 2018 (EST)
:::::::Heh, I didn't know anyone was aware of my predictor app. I actually do have working Traveling Cart code, but it's in the perl script where I originally did my RNG simulating and hasn't been translated over into Javascript yet. I suppose I'll accelerate development on that since there is actual interest from someone other than me. If you make a standalone utility to simulate the cart, the biggest thing I would want to see is a search function.

==v1.3 New Items==
The code for calculating Traveling Cart stock hasn't changed between v1.2 and v1.3.  (Other than the additon of a recipe available only in multi-player).  Cactus Seeds will never be sold at the Traveling Cart since their sell price in &lt;tt>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/tt> is 0.  I'm still working on furniture/decorative items.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:00, 15 May 2018 (BST)
:All new furniture items have IDs of 1792 or above.  In &lt;tt>Utility::getTravelingMerchantStock&lt;/tt>, the call to &lt;tt>getRandomFurniture&lt;/tt> is still seeded with IDs from 0 to 1613, so no new furniture should appear in the Traveling Cart stock.  
:Other new items found in &lt;tt>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/tt> have IDs greater than 790, so they won't appear either.  (The one exception is item 79, the Secret Note, which is eliminated because its category is "asdf".) Items found in &lt;tt>BigCraftables.xnb&lt;/tt> should never appear in the Traveling Cart stock, the same as v1.2. 
:In short, no changes to the page or the underlying template appear to be needed.   [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:29, 26 May 2018 (BST)

==Mechanics==
:''Moved from main page by [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:40, 26 May 2018 (BST)''
The merchant's standard stock is determined by a random number seeded with the game ID (XPath: &lt;code>/SaveGame/uniqueIDForThisGame&lt;/code>) and the days played (XPath: &lt;code>/SaveGame/stats/DaysPlayed&lt;/code>).

For each item slot, a random integer (''num'') in the range [2,790) is chosen. ''num'' is then incremented and wrapped to the range [0,790) until there exists an item that satisfies all of the following conditions:
* ID is equal to ''num'';
* not blacklisted; (see above)
* has a category;
* price greater than 0;
* not named "Weeds";
* type is not "Quest", "Minerals", or "Arch".

The unit price is determined by the larger of 2 random integers in the ranges of [1,11)*100 and [3,6)*base_price. The stack size has a 90% chance to be 1, and 10% chance to be 5.

Note that some items have a higher chance to appear in the standard stock, because after the random integer is chosen, it is incremented until it is equal to a valid object number.

For the furniture slot, a random integer (''num'') in the range [0,1613) is chosen until it there exists a furniture that has ''num'' as its ID and is not blacklisted. The unit price is determined by a random integer in the range of [1,11)*250.

:As far as I can see, the way the id is selected hasn't changed? So some items still have a higher frequency than others? [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 07:44, 13 December 2019 (UTC)
::You may be right.  Feel free to investigate this and report on your findings here.  I was making an assumption that since duplicates are eliminated from the stock, all items would have an equal chance of appearing, but it was just an assumption.  We can always add a column to the tables for percent chance to appear.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:21, 13 December 2019 (UTC)
