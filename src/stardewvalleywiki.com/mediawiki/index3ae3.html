The '''Bus Stop''' is an exterior map near the center of Stardew Valley, and is where you first arrive at the start of the game. The main path through this area connects [[the Farm]] to the west with [[Pelican Town]] to the east. By following the road to the west you can also access the lower section of the [[Backwoods]] (the road cannot be followed to the east).

The [[Minecart]] in the northwest corner of the map is initially broken; once repaired, it provides access to [[the Mines]], [[Pelican Town]] near the [[Blacksmith]], and the [[Quarry]].
 
==The Bus==
The bus is broken down after you arrive and remains so until repaired by the [[Junimos]] after purchasing all of the [[Bundles#Vault|Vault Bundles]] for a total of {{Price|42500}} or by purchasing the Bus repair for {{Price|40000}} from the [[Joja Community Development Form]].

[[Pam]] becomes the Bus Driver once the bus is repaired. She arrives at the Bus Stop at 10:10am and will leave at 5:00pm every day, and tickets are available to purchase for {{Price|500}} during this time. Purchasing a ticket at the machine triggers the bus to take [[the Player]] to [[The Desert|the Calico Desert]]. Tickets include the return trip from the Desert to the Bus Stop.

It is possible to get the bus earlier than 10am by waiting for Pam outside her [[trailer]] at 8:30am and standing in her way. Once she walks through the Player, she will walk significantly faster than usual and reach the bus stop at 9:30am, and a ticket can be purchased as soon as she arrives. 

If Pam is unavailable for the day, she leaves a [[Text Sign]] in front of the bus telling the player why she is out and that they can drive the bus themself. This allows the player to drive to the Calico Desert on Spring 25, when Pam usually has an appointment at [[Harvey's Clinic]], or when she is on vacation at the [[Ginger Island#Island South|Ginger Island Resort]]. The player still has to pay {{Price|500}} to use the bus.

If you leave your [[Animals#Horse|horse]] by the bus stop, when you return from the Desert a message will appear on-screen saying "Your loyal horse waits patiently for your return." or "[Horse's name] is wondering where you have been."

==Foraging==
[[File:BusStopForageLocations.png|thumb|right|300px|Locations at the Bus Stop where forageable items can spawn.]]
[[Foraging|Forageable]] items found on the ground at the Bus Stop are:&lt;ref name="forage_chance" />
* In [[Spring]]: {{name|Daffodil|class=inline}} (45%), {{name|Dandelion|class=inline}} (35%), and {{name|Leek|class=inline}} (20%)
* In [[Summer]]: {{name|Sweet Pea|class=inline}} (47%), {{name|Spice Berry|class=inline}} (27%), and {{name|Grape|class=inline}} (27%)
* In [[Fall]]: {{name|Wild Plum|class=inline}} (60%), and {{name|Hazelnut|class=inline}} (40%)
* In [[Winter]]: {{name|Crocus|class=inline}} (42%), {{name|Holly|class=inline}} (35%), and {{name|Crystal Fruit|class=inline}} (23%)

Forageable items spawn at an average rate of 1.0 per night in spring; in summer, fall, and winter the rate is 0.8 per night.&lt;ref name="forage_spawn"/> The map shows the possible locations as red and magenta tiles; when the original trees are present, the magenta tiles have a 90% smaller chance of spawning items because they are identified as being behind the original trees.

==Artifacts==
[[Artifacts]] that can be found by digging up [[Artifact Spot]]s at the Bus Stop are:
* {{name|Prehistoric Vertebra|class=inline}} (0.7% + 3-5%&lt;ref name="artifact_extra" />)
* {{name|Prehistoric Handaxe|class=inline}} (4%)
* {{name|Prehistoric Tool|class=inline}} (3%)
* {{name|Ancient Doll|class=inline}} (2.4%)
* {{name|Arrowhead|class=inline}} (1.6%)
* {{name|Ancient Drum|class=inline}} (0.7%)
* {{name|Strange Doll (green)|class=inline}} (0.07%)
* {{name|Strange Doll (yellow)|class=inline}} (0.07%)
Other possible items are:
* 1-3 {{name|Clay|class=inline}} (17-34%&lt;ref name="artifact_extra" />)
* {{name|Lost Book|class=inline}} (20% + 4-8%&lt;ref name="artifact_extra" />); once all Lost Books have been found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by {{name|Mixed Seeds|class=inline}}.
* Only in [[Winter]]: {{name|Winter Root|class=inline}} (20%)
* Only in [[Winter]]: {{name|Snow Yam|class=inline}} (14%)
* 1-3 {{name|Stone|class=inline}} (6-11%&lt;ref name="artifact_extra" />)
* 1-3 {{name|Copper Ore|class=inline}} (5-9%&lt;ref name="artifact_extra" />)
* Only in [[Spring]]: 2-5 {{name|Rice Shoot|class=inline}}s (4%)
* An unseen {{name|Secret Note|class=inline}}: up to 3% chance, only if the player has a [[Magnifying Glass]].

Artifact spots spawn at an average rate of 0.11 per night, except in winter when the average rate increases to 0.8 per night.&lt;ref name="artifact_spawn" />

==Villager Paths==
[[File:Pathing-BusStop.png|thumb|right|300px|Locations at the Bus Stop where [[Crafting#Crafted goods outside the farm|villager paths]] can destroy items.]]
Some [[villagers]] walk through the Bus Stop map and have the potential to [[Crafting#Crafted goods outside the farm|destroy]] items:
* [[Pam]] walks back and forth to the bus daily, only after the bus has been repaired.
* [[Abigail]] walks back and forth to the bush northeast of the bus on Tuesdays in the [[Fall]].
* [[Emily]] will take the bus to [[the Desert]] on fall 15, if the bus has been repaired.
* If the player is [[Marriage|married]], their spouse might walk from [[the Farm]] to the [[Pelican Town|town]], passing by the bus stop.

==Unused Content==
The "Bus People" map area was an unused part of the game's introduction. The player was in control at this point, and could move around and interact with people and objects on the bus. This scene was removed from the game before its initial release, but some of the data related to this scene can still be found in the game's files. 

[[File:BusPeople.png|500px]]

===Dialogue===
The source code file &lt;samp>Content\Strings\StringsFromCSFiles.xnb&lt;/samp> contains messages that would have been displayed when the player interacted with the various elements of this scene.

{{Collapse|content=&lt;br />
*(Pet cage next to old lady?) - "It doesn't look too happy in there..."
*(Bathroom Door?) - "Occupied"
*(Bus door?) - "The bus hasn't arrived yet..."
*[[Haley]] - "Oooo... My feet hurt from all that shopping. Hey. Could you ask the driver how long it'll be until we get to Stardew?"
*[[Haley]] (2) - "...well?"
*Man in Red Shirt - "Moustached Man: Don't worry, friend. I've got my eyes peeled for the valley."
*Old Lady - "Old Lady: You're liable to hurt someone, waltzing around on a moving bus!"
*Old Lady (2) - "Old Lady: Ah well, if my knees weren't so stiff I'd probably do the same. Hehee."
*Newspaper Man's Bag - "Man: Get your claws off my bag."
*Newspaper Man's Bag (2) - "Man: ...Did you hear me, kid? Scram!"
*Newspaper Man's Bag (3) - "Man: What are you, some kind of bum?"
*Newspaper Man's Bag (4) - "Man: ...*Sigh*... Kids these days..."
*Newspaper Man's Bag (5) - "Man: For the love of Yoba, get your filthy paws off my designer bag!"
*Newspaper Man's Bag (6) - "Man: That bag costs more than you'll make in ten years!"
*Newspaper Man's Bag (7) - "Man: Arghh!! Take this and leave me alone, you hooligan!" (followed by) "Received 1g."
*Newspaper Man's Bag (8) - "Man: ..."
*Skater Kid (player is male) - "...No response."
*Skater Kid (player is male, 2) - "Kid: 'Sup?"
*Skater Kid (player is female) - "Kid: 'Sup?"
*Skateboard (player is male) - "Kid: Dude, don't touch my board."
*Woman by child - "Lady: We just got back from the Zuzu City fun park... didn't we Simon?" (followed by) "Simon: *babble*... *slurp*"
*Woman by child (2) - "Lady: He's shy around strangers."
*Empty Seat - "Found 20g under the seat!"
*Girl with bow - "Girl: Hi! &lt;" [sic]
*Bus Driver before talking to Haley - "Driver: Hey, you'd better take a seat."
*Bus Driver after talking to Haley - ("Dobson" event starts)
}}

===Dobson===
When the player talks to the bus driver after talking to Haley, an event will start playing involving an unknown character named Dobson. It's possible that "Dobson" was later replaced with the JojaMart manager, [[Morris]]. The source code file &lt;samp>Locations\Bus.cs&lt;/samp> contains the actions and messages that would be take place if the event were able to play out.

{{Collapse|content=&lt;br />
*"Driver: Huh? We're almost there. It should only be a few more minutes."
*(A door close sound effect plays, Dobson appears (from the bathroom?) and faces the player.)
*"Sir? Are you still there? Uh-huh... sorry to put you on hold, sir. I had some business to attend to."
*(Dobson moves) "That's right, sir... I'm on the bus right now, heading to Stardew Valley."
*(Dobson moves and faces a different direction) "I have to say, so far I've been quite unimpressed with the locals."
*(Dobson changes the direction he is looking) "They seem like a docile and unfashionable sort of people. The children look sickly, and all the young men are delinquents from what I've seen so far..."
*(Dobson moves and faces another direction (possibly at the Joja Mart sign?)) "Although, they are displaying our corporate logo, which you'll be pleased to hear, sir."
*(Dobson moves and faces another direction) "*snort* ... Yes, sir. It definitely won't be a problem to get these country rubes to sign the paperwork... We'll have that new Joja Hypermarket up and running in no time. Then maybe we can discuss that new-"
*"Moustached Man: Everyone, look!!"
*(The map tileset changes -- perhaps showing the bus coming to a stop in Stardew Valley?)
*"Moustached Man: There it is! Stardew Valley!"
*(Dobson faces the player.)
*(The scene ends.)
}}

==Gallery==
The bus ticket shown below was never implemented in the released version of the game. It was intended to appear in the Player's wallet. In v1.3, the bus ticket image was replaced in game files with the [[Magnifying Glass]] image.

==Trivia==
*After repairing the bus, [[Lewis]] will say "...did you hear? It seems the old town bus started working again overnight! That old thing has been dormant for decades... This is truly a great mystery."
*If the player warps to [[the Desert]] then takes the bus back, the player will drive the bus (even if [[Pam]] is still at the Bus Stop).
*There is a video interpretation of the deleted content located at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmAqmihyooU
*If the player zooms out on mobile, they may see the bus coming in from the black space.
*Prior to v1.3, the bus door when getting repaired in the cutscene had a black line in the door, the door sprite was removed in v1.3.

==History==
{{History|1.6|Now has a wider map (preventing black bars from appearing at the sides of the screen), although the distance to traverse it remains the same. Pam is no longer required to be at the Bus Stop to drive to [[The Desert|the Calico Desert]] on days she is unavailable.}}
