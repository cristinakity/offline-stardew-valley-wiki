[[File:Marriage abigail.png|right|thumb|Wedding ceremony with Abigail]]
In singleplayer mode, '''Marriage''' is possible only with a [[Villagers|villager]] who is marked as "single" in the Social tab.  

Before proposing marriage, the player needs to earn 10 hearts of [[friendship]] with their intended partner, which requires them to have first given a [[bouquet]] at 8 hearts of friendship.  They will also need to [[Carpenter's Shop#House Upgrades|upgrade]] the [[farmhouse]] at least once and have access to the [[The Beach#Tide Pools|Tide Pool]] area of [[The Beach]]. The lost book ''[[Lost Books#Marriage Guide for Farmers|Marriage Guide for Farmers]]'' also explains this process.

&lt;/gallery>

==Romance==
Romance can only begin once you have reached 8 [[friendship|hearts]] with a potential partner (where friendship levels freeze for marriage candidates).

===Dating===
The morning after you first reach 8 hearts with a marriage candidate, [[Pierre]] will mail you a message to let you know about the [[bouquet]] ({{Price|200}} at [[Pierre's General Store]]):

{{Quote|It seems like you're starting to get close with some of the townspeople. If you want to show someone that you're romantically interested, you've got to give them one of my beautiful flower bouquets. I'm selling them now, for a very fair price! If you want to start a family someday, this is the first step!|Pierre}}

Giving the bouquet unfreezes the friendship level with that bachelor or bachelorette, allowing friendship to advance. Upon accepting the bouquet, their Social tab status also changes to "boyfriend" or "girlfriend". The bouquet can be given to multiple candidates, without regard to gender. There is no [[friendship]] penalty for giving bouquets to dating rivals, though there is a [[Bouquet#Group 10-Heart Event|Group Heart event]] that occurs if you are dating all 6 candidates of either gender, which may cause all girl/boyfriends to give you the "cold shoulder" for a week.

===Breaking Up===
Giving a marriage candidate a [[Wilted Bouquet]] ends the dating relationship.  The marriage candidate's [[friendship]] level will immediately drop to 5 hearts upon receiving one, and will have unique reactions to receiving it.

===Proposing Marriage===
The day after reaching 10 [[friendship]] hearts with a marriage candidate, the player receives a letter from Mayor [[Lewis]]:

{{Quote|I'm going to give you this advice because I like you and I want you to stay in Pelican Town. If there comes a day that you want to ask for someone's hand in marriage, you'll need to give them a '[[Mermaid's Pendant]]'. Don't worry, everyone in Pelican Town understands the significance of the amulet. It's an ancient tradition in this region. Good luck!|Lewis}}

To become engaged, the player must present a [[Mermaid's Pendant]] to their intended partner. They will need to buy it for {{Price|5000}} from the [[Old Mariner]], who can be found on rainy days at [[The Beach#Tide Pools|the tidal pools on the beach]] (which can only be reached either by repairing the bridge for 300 [[wood]] or by purchasing the [[Carpenter's Shop#Community Upgrade|second community upgrade]] from [[Robin]]). During [[Winter]], he will only appear if a [[Rain Totem]] is used. He will not sell the pendant unless the farmhouse has been upgraded at least once, the player is at 10 hearts with an eligible villager, and the player is not already married.

After the Mermaid's Pendant is accepted, the [[Calendar]] will have a Mermaid's Pendant icon on the wedding day.

===The Wedding===
[[File:WeddingDayHeart.png|right|thumb|The weather icon is replaced with a heart on the wedding day.]]
The wedding ceremony takes place in the morning, 3 days after you propose. That is, if you propose on Monday the 1st, the marriage cutscene will take place as soon as you wake up on Thursday the 4th. When the ceremony is completed, you and your spouse appear at the farmhouse at 6am (on the porch, or if you have restarted or reloaded the game day, inside the house). The day then proceeds as it normally does when you are married. Friendship with your spouse can now rise to 14 hearts, but decays by 20 points per day whenever there is no contact between you two.

The wedding ceremony does not take place on a day that another event takes place in the town square or a [[Green Rain|Green Rain]] day. In such cases, the wedding is delayed until there is a day without such an event.

On the day of the wedding, the weather icon that appears between the date and time is replaced with a heart. The weather will also always be sunny on that day regardless of the Weather Report's forecast the day before.

==Married Life==
Once a villager has been married, they will move into the [[farmhouse]]. They will have a maximum of 14 hearts instead of 10, and keeping them happy will result in them helping around [[The Farm|the farm]]. A happy spouse might make breakfast, feed animals, repair [[Crafting#Fences|fences]] or water [[crops]]. They occasionally change the [[wallpaper]] or [[flooring]] of the [[Farmhouse]], or add a piece of [[furniture]] to a room. Interacting with your spouse when no dialogue is available will result in an embrace.

[[File:Spouse relationship meter.png]]

It is also possible to have [[children]] under certain circumstances.

Once married, the gifting limit of twice a week is removed; however, the once a day limit still applies.

===Spouse Chores===
*Watering all crops on the farm (in [[spring]], [[summer]], and [[fall]]).
*Feeding all [[animals]].
*Watering the [[Animals#Cat or Dog|pet]] bowl.
*Repairing broken [[Crafting#Fences|fences]].
*Giving gifts, including [[Cooking|breakfast and dinner dishes]].  (If inventory is full, the item will not be received.)

===Stardrop===
After reaching 12.5 Hearts (3125 [[friendship]] points) with your spouse, the player can receive a [[Stardrop]] as a token of their love.  In [[multiplayer]] games where two players marry each other, the Stardrop appears as a present in a small purple box next to each player's bed upon waking up in the morning.

Only one Stardrop can be obtained in this manner per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer.

===Spouse Rooms===
Once married, the player's spouse will immediately set up a unique room inside the [[Farmhouse]], located to the right of the bedroom.  Note that [[Emily]]'s parrot will not be visible to anyone in [[multiplayer]] who has not completed her 4 heart event.

===Spouse Outside Area===
In addition to their room inside the [[farmhouse]], each spouse occupies a unique 2x8 area, north-east of the house's initial location on each [[Farm Maps|map]]. In [[multiplayer]], only the host player's spouse has this area.

===Exhaustion===
Kissing your spouse will remove [[Energy|exhaustion]] from your energy bar.  This works only with the first kiss of the day, when a heart appears over your heads.

===Messy House===
If an object is obstructing the path your spouse takes in the farmhouse, they will say, ''"You could have cleaned up in here a little while I was gone... It's not very nice to have to wade through a bunch of junk after a hard day's work."''

If your spouse cannot reach the kitchen, they will say, ''"You've got a bunch of your stuff blocking the kitchen... I guess you're not getting dinner tonight."''

If there are monsters inside, such as [[slimes]], your spouse will ask, ''"Um... Honey? Why are there monsters in the house?"''

If there was no [[Furniture#Beds|bed]] in the house the prior evening, your spouse will comment on their lack of sleep.
:*''"Where am I supposed to sleep...?"''
:*''"I wasn't able to sleep well last night..."''
:*''"I had to sleep on the floor last night..."''
:*''"Did something happen to our bed...?"''

They will also turn with an annoyed expression when you try to kiss them.

===Jealousy===
If you give a gift that is not hated to one of the other marriage candidates when you are already married, there is a chance that your spouse will become jealous. This only happens if the villager receiving the gift has already accepted a bouquet from you, and is of the same gender as your spouse - ''i.e.,'' if you married a bachelor, it only happens if you give a gift to another bachelor. It doesn't matter if the gift is liked or not, the only gift that is safe to give is a birthday gift. (Note that delivery quests do not count as gifts.) The chance that your spouse becomes jealous is between 20 and 40%, depending on daily [[luck]]. If your spouse becomes jealous, you get a 30 friendship point penalty, and the next time you speak to your spouse they will give an angry message mentioning your gift.&lt;ref name="jealousy" />

==Children==
{{main article|Children}}
You can have children only if you have upgraded the Farmhouse for the second time, adding the nursery. After you go to bed for the night, your spouse might randomly ask if you want to have/adopt a child. You can answer "yes" or "not now." Same-gender couples will adopt children, and opposite-gender couples will have biological children.

==Divorce==
Players can visit the [[Mayor's Manor]] where a small book inside will give them the option to divorce their spouse. A divorce costs {{Price|50000}}. After filing for divorce, players have the option to cancel before the end of the day (until 10pm when [[Lewis]]' house closes). If they don't cancel, their spouse, spouse's room, and unique outside area will be gone the next morning, and their friendship level will return to 0 hearts. Under their name it will state "(ex)".

After the divorce, the spouse will move back to their old residence, and will have negative interactions with the player, citing the failure of their marriage. They will also not accept any gifts from them.  (Note that the player can still enter the ex-spouse's bedroom or home, as if the player had 2 friendship hearts with the ex-spouse.)  Any children from the marriage will stay at the [[farmhouse]].  Any items the player had placed in the ex's room will be collected and placed in a [[chest]] the day after the divorce. Divorced spouses neither attend the player's wedding nor treat them normally during [[Festivals]].

Players can visit the [[Witch's Hut]] in late game where they'll find a shrine which can erase all ex-spouses' memories for an offering of {{Price|30000}} (this will also wipe [[Krobus]]' memory if he is an ex-roommate). Afterward, all ex-spouses will have no memory of the previous marriage, allowing players to date and remarry them if they choose. Note that if the player decides to remarry they will not see the bachelor/bachelorette's previously seen heart events, as the heart events can only be seen once per save file, or once per player in Multiplayer. 

Children from marriage can also be 'turned into doves' at the [[Witch's Hut]] in exchange for a [[Prismatic Shard]]. This permanently removes those children from the game, but further children can be had with another partner. (Note that if a divorce is filed and then canceled on the same day, more children can be had with the same partner.)

If the player is expecting a child and gets a divorce, the child will not be born/delivered.

==Bugs==
*A divorced spouse may make a "[[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|Help Wanted" request]]. When fulfilling the quest, the spouse will express gratitude before going back to angry/hurt dialogue. Fulfilling a quest for an ex-spouse does not grant any [[friendship]] points with the ex-spouse.
*If the player completes all bundles in a room in the [[Community Center]] the day before getting married, the [[Junimos]]' overnight cutscene will be skipped.
