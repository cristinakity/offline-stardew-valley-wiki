<h2><span id="Most_Helpful_Contribution_(Especially_From_New_Editors)"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Most_Helpful_Contribution_.28Especially_From_New_Editors.29">Most Helpful Contribution (Especially From New Editors)</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I’ve been checking out the recent changes page every so often for a while now in anticipation of the new release and it’s clear that you have a lot on your hands. The “Help Editing” page doesn’t give any pointers towards the kind of changes that would be most helpful to you and the wiki, so <b>(a)</b> I was wondering if you had any in mind (or if there’s a “wanted tasks” list that I missed!)
</p><p>Two more related questions - 
</p><p><b>(b)</b> if a user spots vandalism before you get to it, do you prefer that they leave it to you or revert the change?
</p><p><b>(c)</b> the “help editing” page says that changes in formatting should be applied across all languages. What exactly does that encompass? I assume new information can be added to only one language, but what about adding a new section to an article?
</p><p>And finally, one question that is only partially related - <b>(d)</b> do you think it could be worth adding a note to Emily’s page explaining why Clint isn’t one of her friends, as this seems to be a common cause of confusion and incorrect edits? I’m sure this is on her talk page but it may be worth adding to the actual page for those users who only read the wiki. --<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Gravy" title="User:Gravy">Gravy</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gravy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gravy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:27, 2 January 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello Gravy! I haven't had a "help wanted" list since v1.3, so, no, there's nothing I can point you to. After v1.6 releases, it's going to be a free-for-all, so knock yourself out then (so to speak). :D</dd>
<dd>You should clean up vandalism if you see it. If a vandal has made several changes to a page, that involves hitting the "undo" link multiple times, starting with the most recent change, and working backwards. It's time-consuming and can be confusing looking through the version history list, but that's the best way to ensure information isn't changed or lost in the process. If I come along later and see something has changed, I may revert the cleanup and then revert the vandalism, because I have access to more powerful links to do so. You should <i>not</i> take it personally! I appreciate vandalism clean-up!</dd>
<dd>Changes to existing formatting require discussion, adding a new section (if it's substantial) should also be discussed. When version 1.6 is released, new information will be added without discussing formatting, as people discover it. New pages and sections will be added, and no one is expected to add them to all 12 languages. But until then, formatting changes encompass everything on the wiki.</dd>
<dd>As for Emily and Clint, they may well be friends after v1.6 is released. There is new dialogue being added, so we may (or may not) see more of their relationship being revealed. I don't know. The basis for "friendship" was always "if they give a gifting hint, they're friends, otherwise not." But I added <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship#Gift_Preference_Dialogues" title="Friendship">a table</a> for that and removed the field from the infobox on each villager's page, so their friendship is subjective and open to interpretation now. I don't think we need to take action until after v1.6 is released.</dd>
<dd>I'll update <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> to reflect that some of the "rules" don't apply to version 1.6 as well.

<p>Margot, on 31 Dec 23 you reversed an edit by 9000 that stated Harvey needed to be in the clinic in order to trigger the 8-heart event. Are you sure? I have documented (privately) that his presence is required for both 4-heart and 8-heart events. I think that game behavior disagrees with the event file.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fertilizer">Fertilizer</span></h2>
<p>I'm glad I found an acceptable edit for my recent findings about Deluxe Retaining Soil. Since then, I've continued some investigations and think I may have more to distribute across various articles on the subject, but I'm not likely to find a way to make those edits that wouldn't be disruptive in the context of the v1.6 release, so I will be holding off. I also need to formulate just what it is I ought to say, so I have no material to look at right away. And I hear that v1.6 may be close? So, just a heads up that something's pending with me, and it might affect structures within somewhat (not sure). I do find there's not much said about fallow but tillable soil, and that whole subject does have implications for fertilizer, so I've got to look around and find where that belongs. All the best for v1.6! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 20:43, 13 February 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thanks for the heads up! You may find that I'm so frazzled, I don't care what you change... (Don't tell anyone, though!)</dd>
<dd>I don't know how close v1.6 is, there are a fair few bugs to be fixed, but when it's released you might find some things have changed with regard to fertilizer. The alpha change notes (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Migrate_to_Stardew_Valley_1.6#Vanilla_release_notes" title="Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6">Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6#Vanilla release notes</a>) already contain a change to tilled soil underneath <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting#Seeds" title="Crafting">seasonal Wild Seeds</a> on Ginger Island, so if you're going to deal with those type of seeds, there may be even more changes with v1.6. You may find a bug specific to v1.6 as well, although I hope not.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, thanks again for the heads up. Please proceed with your project, and have fun! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 23:00, 14 February 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>And thanks for the v1.6 heads up, too. I think now that the best approach won't end up changing article structures much: perhaps a new section, once, mostly paragraphs and/or sentences. So that doesn't look too serious. "V1.6 close" is what I've been hearing since November, so I think I won't wait. Who knows when it will be, really? A Wild Seeds change sounds like a special case wrt the stuff I've been digging up - a detail, not a basic behavior. Should be a small change once it comes. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 00:25, 16 February 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Something strange has caught my attention in my two days of being on the Stardew Valley wiki. Every single edit of mine has been deleted or reversed. Strange?... I look at the revision history of all the changes I have made, and something strange sticks out to me. All of the changes done by you? What a coincidence!

<ul><li>as both a Console and PC player, I noticed that some features available on PC are not available to be accessed on Console (e.g., Some Profile Easter eggs like clicking on Haley's picture) . So, to be helpful, I added a little bit of info, so console players don't get stuck trying to do something that they can't do. And no, it's not a bug. You physically cannot click on the pictures for a reason. It would be frustrating if, instead of scrolling through two options (scroll left, scroll right), there was a middle option that didn't do anything useful other than waste your time.</li>
<li>the glitches page: You had a discussion? No, you didn't. I can see past logs. You know that, right? You came to an agreement with yourself that that page shouldn't exist. Adding onto that, your original gripe with the first version of the page was that it was dedicated to a single glitch. My new page was devoted to a plethora of glitches not jus the single one you had a problem with.</li>
<li>Guys can get pregnant. Yeah, you heard that? Not every person who sets their farmer to male has a pair of testicles. If I were a trans guy, I think I would like to know if my farmer is getting pregnant or my spouse or if I had an option.</li>
<li>I literally uses the exact same format as the other info on the heart event page.</li></ul>
<p>Honestly I feel like It would make everybody's life's easier if we had an actual formatting rules page instead a single page that doesn't really say mutch.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1.6_Release_Date">1.6 Release Date</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I have two quick questions - 1) concernedape's twitter seems to say v1.6 will be released on the 19th, but in your above reply you said 21st. Did I miss something somewhere? (just wanted to make sure both for myself and in case you accidentally had the wrong date down!) 2) is it worth adding the release date to the main page? I know this is something you would have to do and it's only two weeks away, so it may not be, but not everyone has an X/twitter account and seeing the announcement tweet is difficult without it for some reason (I had to follow a link from an article to see it). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Gravy" title="User:Gravy">Gravy</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Gravy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Gravy (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 01:22, 3 March 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Crafting_Ingredients">Crafting Ingredients</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for your message. I didn't realize 1.6 was coming out so soon or I probably would have waited. And I also didn't realize big changes have to be approved first. Yes, I found the cooking ingredients so helpful on that page that I copied that format. One reason I think my format is better than a short list as in your example is I find it very helpful to have the items divided by category and with their seasons specified. Then I know that in Spring I need to get certain crops, for example, or these are all the things I need to get from the mines. And there's a precedent for that format, and also for having it on the same page, on the cooking page as you mentioned. If I were going to put those ingredients on a separate page, then I think the cooking ingredients should also be moved to a separate page for consistency. Shouldn't those two pages be consistent? I know that my longer format is a tremendous amount of work (and it was) which is probably why it hadn't been done before, but other than it almost being out-of-date, since someone's done it, could the update stand once I've edited it for 1.6? Thanks for your appreciation, btw. I made a similar update on the RSV wiki for a lot of information that was missing on the quests page and my changes were reverted without any message or explanation. Never played RSV again, lol. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Susb8383&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Susb8383 (page does not exist)">Susb8383</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Susb8383" title="User talk:Susb8383">talk</a>) 21:16, 17 March 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Yes, yes, and yes. Oh, and I'm sorry about the RSV wiki!</dd>
<dd>Yes, your longer format is fine if you feel it's helpful, and yes, we can build the tables once v1.6 is released. I would strongly prefer a link to the page, so that the page would be "Crafting/Ingredients" (a sub-page of Crafting) and then a simple link to it under a heading "Ingredients".</dd>
<dd>And yes, the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cooking" title="Cooking">Cooking</a> page should be the same! Unfortunately, there is only one of me, and 12 languages to try desperately to keep cohesive. With all the 1.6 changes (and all the daily changes across all 12 languages), moving ingredients to a separate page has been pushed to the bottom of the "to do" list. One of us could easily do it in English, but then what about the other languages? It's a relatively simple change, someone just has to find the correct translation for "see [this page]" and then move the section. It sounds straight-forward, but around language #6 you start to think "Wowsers, this is a lot of work, did I make a mistake in German, oh geez, I have to check that" and then you lose your place... Well, it gets complicated very fast. Having said that, if you want to attempt that change in all 12 languages, that would be stupendous. (!!)</dd>
<dd>Otherwise, we'll concentrate on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crafting" title="Crafting">Crafting</a> for now, start creating the tables in 2 days, and then migrating the changes to the other languages will be part of v1.6 changes, more likely for translators to pick up and do themselves.</dd>

I added this information to a Mossy Tree page, and another user alerted me that their mossy seed had grown into a different tree, which when they looked into the .xnb files for, they found under tree 1 Green rain. Their tree cannot be tapped like mine, but it spreads seeds around it (whereas I'm not sure mine does). Now we have these two confirmed (but separate) trees that grow from the same seed, with a possible third variant (the file tree 2 Green rain) coming from the mossy seed as well. It seems that these are called the Fiddlehead Stalk (tree 3 Green rain) and the Wild Tree (tree 1 Green rain), but I'm not sure how to validate the legitimacy of these names...? Right now the Fiddlehead Stalk is named under the Mossy Tree page, and I was wondering if there was a way to update it to a new name once one is confirmed, and also on how to proceed with formatting when 1 seed can produce many variants of a tree. Should it be three separate tree pages, or one page with all of them? Thank you so much for any guidance.
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello anonymous editor! The fact is, there is no in-game name for these trees, and I don't know what to call them to differentiate them from other trees that have moss on them. If we stick to the game files, then they are "Green Rain Trees". They all start with the green rain event.</dd>
<dd>I think we should discuss the proper name for them, and try (try!) to decide quickly, before the name gets copied into 11 other languages and becomes an indelible part of history. If we have already decided on "Mossy Tree" then we need to be explicit about the difference between a "Mossy Tree" and a tree with Moss on it. Because "Mossy Trees" come with and without moss on them. 🥴 <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:44, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Just chipping into this discussion, I agree that calling is Mossy Tree is a bit confusing with the other trees which can also have Moss on them. I think this name comes from the fact that these trees can be grown using <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mossy_Seed" title="Mossy Seed">Mossy Seed</a>, which is a bit of a misnomer since its not necessarily moss related. Perhaps 'Green Rain Trees' is the best we can do.<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:YuvixAdun" title="User:YuvixAdun">YuvixAdun</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:YuvixAdun" title="User talk:YuvixAdun">talk</a>) 17:23, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Adding my bit since I've been helping do some research and editing for the Mossy Seed and Mossy Tree Wiki pages.  From what I've seen, The trees have been labelled as the Fiddlehead Stalk and the Wild Trees(as there are two of these variations) by the community.  The other editor and I were in the process of asking an admin(not sure who) how to handle formatting of a seed that produces 3 variations of tree, but the Mossy Tree wiki page seems to be no more.<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Tmh" title="User:Tmh">Tmh</a> 3:08 PM, 23 March 2024 (CST)
<dl><dd>i was gonna suggest to name the new tree just "wild tree" as it's mentioned in both the mossy seed and mushroom log's descriptions (that log seems to work the best with these trees), but i'm not sure now since those other seed trees could also be considered "wild" 😅 <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Sooji_gooji" title="User:Sooji gooji">Sooji gooji</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Sooji_gooji&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Sooji gooji (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 21:30, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd><s>Hey, there's been a discussion <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Talk:Green_Rain_Trees" title="Talk:Green Rain Trees">here</a> about various "Green Rain Tree" things, but I'll repeat my latest post there. "I'm just now realizing that the term "Mossy Tree" was removed and replaced with Green Rain Trees, but I personally believe that it should be reverted. I feel like that is what it should logically be called, and "Green Rain Trees" seems sort of weird, considering that they come from other sources besides that event. We can just put one of those notes at the top of the pages that says "Not to be confused with trees covered in moss."" Additionally, some of the specific variations are considered "Wild Trees" so that wouldn't work either. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Brandon_Echols" title="User:Brandon Echols">Brandon Echols</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Brandon_Echols" title="User talk:Brandon Echols">talk</a>) 00:29, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Ok, quite a bit has happened. I feel that it should stay as "Green Rain Trees" so forget everything I said above. This is mainly because "Wild Trees" is a new concept that consists of all trees in the wild. Because of this, <b>Wild Tree</b> would need to be moved to a page called <b>Bushy Mossy Tree</b> and <b>Lush Wild Tree</b> needs to be moved to Leafy Mossy Tree. These Bushy and Leafy adjectives actually come from the game code so it’s official. This also means that the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mossy_Tree" class="mw-redirect" title="Mossy Tree">Mossy Tree</a> page can be changed to a “disambiguation page” (a list of what it may mean) of sorts. I can handle this, as long as you take the protection off that page, though.&#160;:) And don't worry-I'll make sure to add plenty of "Not to be confused with..." notices. I know this is a confusing topic, but I believe that this is the least confusing method. Margotbean, because you have the permission to move pages, I would appreciate if you could do this.&#160;:) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Brandon_Echols" title="User:Brandon Echols">Brandon Echols</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Brandon_Echols" title="User talk:Brandon Echols">talk</a>) 02:25, 27 March 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="1.6_Fish_Code_changes">1.6 Fish Code changes</span></h2>
<p>As you may know, 1.6 changed the coding for special fish spawns (e.g. Legendary fish, Night Market fish, fishing presents, etc.). Pre-1.6, their spawns were taken care of in functions called getFish in the game code. However, for most of them, their spawns are now taken care of in Data\Locations.xnb. Upon inspection, very few (if any) of their percentage chances of catching have actually changed. Therefore, I will change all of the necessary getFish references to reference Data\Locations.xnb instead. Letting you know because these changes won't need history sections as nothing related to the actual gameplay changes.

<h2><span id="Inventory,_Tabs,_Player_Menu"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Inventory.2C_Tabs.2C_Player_Menu">Inventory, Tabs, Player Menu</span></h2>
<p>I'm confused about the use of terminology and the organization of the Wiki regarding matters intersecting these items. "Inventory" has long meant the first tab of (the Player Menu?, or what?), and its page seems to indicate that it's just the first tab. But I'm not sure we're consistent about using "inventory" in that way. We have separate articles for other tabs, some of those new, but where do we describe what a "Tab" really is and where to find it? Inventory? We seem to have no article that draws all the tabs together (no "Player Menu"), to describe such a central UI feature. And isn't "Player Menu" often used as inventory? I think it's all a bit jumbled, and the website lacks sufficient topical articles to help sort out distinctions and separations from unions and conjunctions. Now is as good a time as any to put any changes into practice.
</p><p>One more element to this: Mastery. The Mastery Tab displays just the Powers of the masteries, not all the effects of them. The <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mastery_Cave" title="Mastery Cave">Mastery Cave</a> article certainly could be used to put all mastery features together, but that would probably mean listing the powers there as well, introducing replication, yet the tab needs the info also.
</p><p>So I'm asking for guidance on how the Wiki should be structured, for all of us. But I'm also asking for terminology intent, that the texts may be clear. It's certainly a bundle!
</p><p>There's also a little matter of how the player is supposed to be able to track progress towards the next mastery level in-game, when the Mastery Tab doesn't seem to give that information. I've got that on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Talk:Mastery_Cave" title="Talk:Mastery Cave">Talk:Mastery Cave</a> too, but if you know...  Thanks for your patience! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 02:08, 29 March 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I can address some of that! The player menu refers to the entire set of tabs that pops up in-game when you hit "E" or "Esc" by default. The player tab is the 2nd tab from the left on that menu, right after the inventory tab. It does introduce difficulty, since both terms use "player". But the two are different! Some places refer to it as the "Skills Tab" as well, which isn't awful, but outdated.</dd>
<dd>When I get the chance to breathe, I can make more wiki changes. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:43, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks! The more I look at it, the more I'm inclined towards the idea of a Player Menu article. I could write up a good intro right now, starting with the clarifications you just gave me. It would need an image - of the default display when it pops up. But that's essentially the "Inventory Screen" section of <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a> right now, which needs updating anyway. Splitting off that part of Inventory would lead to two short articles, true, but it would also make distinct the shift between global and local foci of topics and emphasize where all the many tab articles are centered. Just a thought. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 18:24, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Second thought, in place of the original above. Perhaps Player Menu could be a name redirect in the article space - to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Inventory" title="Inventory">Inventory</a>. Inventory is the way it pops up, and separate sections could be devoted to the two purposes, with the need for only one image to oversee all, and wording to avoid duplications. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:15, 29 March 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

But if the relevant code is in a bigger function (like several hundred lines long), do I only point to the function or add extra details (e.g. <samp>Foo.Bar::Baz</samp>, <samp>case 35</samp>?

<p>Hello <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">Margotbean</a>, I noticed that the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Collections" title="Collections">Collections</a> page, and the template it uses, <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Template:Collections_Items_Shipped" title="Template:Collections Items Shipped">Template:Collections_Items_Shipped</a>, was not updated yet.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Redirects">Redirects</span></h2>
<p>I've been adding some redirects to the wiki and you've been deleting them. Personally, I think the redirects provide a tremendous amount of value. However, since you've been deleting them, presumably you think they are just clutter and/or not necessary. Would you allow me to possibly convince you otherwise? As a basic example, take the case of "book seller". If I type that into the wiki, it currently <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://imgur.com/a/fDK1KVo">looks like this</a>, giving 0 results and giving the appearance that such a thing does not exist on the wiki at all. However, of course that is a lie, because the page "Bookseller" exists. This is confusing because in normal English, "book seller" is always separated as two words. The only reason that it is different on the wiki is because ConcernedApe made a typo / grammatical error when implementing it into the game, and the wiki explicitly follows the in-game conventions.
</p><p>You could imagine a scenario with a user being something along the lines of: "Oh, the Book Seller is in town today. I remember from last time that they sell rare books, but I don't remember anymore which specific ones that are sold. No problem, let me look that up on the wiki! [types in "book seller", gets no results]. What the heck? I guess the wiki doesn't have any information on the book seller yet, so let me just do a Google search for "stardew book seller" and see what I can find. [does Google search] Wait a second, the Google search just pointed me back to the wiki. Oh, I see the problem now, bookseller is one word on the wiki. That's really annoying!"
</p><p>We can fix up this user story with a redirect. By making "book seller" redirect to "bookseller", we can plant users exactly where they expect to be with 0 friction. Perhaps we could call these type of redirects "search redirects", which have the explicit goal of saving the user time or preventing a second click and/or a second google search. Unfortunately, I know that such "search redirects" will show up in the MediaWiki admin tools as "orphaned pages" that don't link anywhere else, which will make them show up alongside other legitimate pages that do need to be deleted. However, I think that search redirects provide so much value that they should be excepted. Please consider this request. --<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zamiel" title="User:Zamiel">Zamiel</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zamiel" title="User talk:Zamiel">talk</a>) 10:14, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi, to your specific mention of "Bookseller" - the word <i>does</i> exist in English; it is a noun that is defined as the proprietor of a bookstore or one who sells books. (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../../external.html?link=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller">https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller</a>) ConcernedApe did NOT make a typo or grammatical error.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>So, while redirects might be useful in some circumstances, for this one, it is moot. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Rogue.toast" title="User:Rogue.toast">Rogue.toast</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Rogue.toast" title="User talk:Rogue.toast">talk</a>) 21:01, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>My inquiry is not just about bookseller. It is about "search redirects" more generally. Search redirects provide value regardless of whether or not the word exists in a dictionary. I could come up with some equally compelling example that does not exist in the dictionary. e.g. Joja Mart --&gt; JojaMart --<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zamiel" title="User:Zamiel">Zamiel</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zamiel" title="User talk:Zamiel">talk</a>) 23:48, 3 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

I feel like I wasn't doing anything wrong, my edit was constructive (I added a ton of links that readers can immediately visit in order to read more info on things mentioned in the changelog), and I even removed an inaccurate edit (eg. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Meowmere" title="Meowmere">Meowmere</a> is not mentioned anywhere on the official changelog because it is secret, but it is listed on the wiki's changelog). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Anzasquiddles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Anzasquiddles (page does not exist)">Anzasquiddles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Anzasquiddles&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Anzasquiddles (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:30, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Removing info, even if you feel it's a secret, is cause for reverting it. You also linked to a lot of redirects instead of main links.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scythe">Scythe</span></h2>
<p>Hey there, on my last edit I just removed the section that stated, "If it is lost (by dying in the Mines, for example), a new one should spawn the next morning, either next to the bed or in the refrigerator." which I mentioned in my edit history. In the 1.6 update ConcernedApe fixed this issue, so that none of the scythes can no longer be lost. 
</p><p>Ps. I understand that you don't want 1 page for all the scythes, but I thought it might be better to just update the pages individually. For example the Iridium Scythe page does not state that with it "upgrade" (obtaining it) its chance of chance of adding a piece of hay to the silo, when cutting grass goes from 75% to 100%. (when compared gold scythe to iridium) I was just gonna focus on changes like that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="GiftHeader_displays_outdated_info">GiftHeader displays outdated info</span></h2>
<p>hi boss<br />as of 1.6, several villagers have new dialogue when given gifts on their birthday (Jas, Vincent, Penny, Shane, Lewis...). the GiftHeader tag does not account for this and still shows the old generic dialogue. i assumed the most elegant solution was to simply remove the GiftHeader tag and manually write in the info it displays, including the new dialogue, but I've been shouted at for attempting this. will GiftHeader be updated to account for the new dialogue?
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello DrDean (remember to sign posts with 4 tiles, plz!), sorry for the shouty caps. The answer to your question really depends on whether or not someone wants to update the template in all 12 languages. Today is the first day I'm able to access the wiki without errors since v1.6 released, so I can tentatively start to make template changes, but there are several (<b>several</b>) changes to be made. So, do you know what a switch/case is? Do you have any interest in changing the template in all 12 languages? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 20:06, 11 April 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>it's alright, i understand the frustration. this is my point though - it seems like more hassle than it's worth to update the template to account for every edge case. unfortunately i'm monolingual and have a very loose understanding of wiki formatting so i won't be much help with it. perhaps the part of GiftHeader that contains birthday dialogue could be removed, and each villager's page could have their respective birthday dialogue written in manually? so it would look like ==Gifts==, then {{GiftHeader}}, then 'For loved or liked gifts, Jas will say...' etc. i would happily do this for the English wiki but unfortunately i won't be much help for any of the translations. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">DrDeanDingleman</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:48, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It might be better that way, but that would still require changes to the template (in all 12 languages). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 18:37, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>i could do that then, with your permission? i suppose i don't need to understand the language to remove info. this would leave the non-English wikis without any birthday dialogue for a while until a proper translator wrote it in, but if you're okay with that i can go ahead and change the template(s). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">DrDeanDingleman</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:DrDeanDingleman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:DrDeanDingleman (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:33, 20 April 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>NO. The translations are in data files and must be added to the template.

<dl><dd>Would it be helpful in the meantime to collect the custom birthday dialog for each language? I don't know how to access data files, but anyone can copy it down by switching the language in-game, as long as they know enough about the language to write it accurately using a keyboard (if it doesn't use a latin alphabet). That way when someone is able to make the changes to the template, they will already have most of the missing data. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Scarecrow" title="User:Scarecrow">Scarecrow</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Scarecrow&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Scarecrow (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:55, 20 April 2024 (UTC)

<i>Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0</i> into this: <i>Grangeptsrow|Crab|Crab|100|-4|qualities=0,1</i> , but it doesn't work. I noticed that you are the one who created the grangeptsrow template, so maybe you know why it isn't working.--<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Rayram&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rayram (page does not exist)">Rayram</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Rayram&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Rayram (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:31, 16 April 2024 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flooring_Images_and_Icons">Flooring Images and Icons</span></h2>
<p>Hey, thought I should let you know that you missed the majority of new Flooring options added in 1.6. 32 regular, numbered flooring options were added in 1.6 (in "walls_and_floors.xnb"), in addition to the 9 "MoreFloors:X" floors. I'd address the issue myself, but I'm not sure exactly how you were extracting item icons from the game, given I was unable to find anything other the actual floor textures. These 32 numbered floors are all available from the regular catalogue, between (FL)55 (the pink love hearts one, old highest index floor) and MoreFloors:0 (the new dark wood planks). This also messes up the indexing for floor images, which might require admin powers to fix. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Sicarious&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Sicarious (page does not exist)">Sicarious</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Sicarious" title="User talk:Sicarious">talk</a>) 13:43, 18 April 2024 (UTC)

<p>Why exactly did you revert my edit of the wicked statue image? The crafting recipe for it gives the variant without red eyes, so I feel that that's the better "default" image for it. Though, when I uploaded it, it seems that cloudflare had cached the old version, so the new image didn't show up properly (see the comment i left in the page source of <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Wicked_Statue" title="Wicked Statue">Wicked Statue</a>). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Trillian" title="User:Trillian">~trillian</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Trillian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Trillian (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:48, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Perhaps a better question might be "Why <i>exactly</i> did you upload images without reading the section on images in <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>?"</dd>
<dd>To answer your question <i>exactly</i>: I had no idea what you were doing, replacing an image from 2017 that's used on multiple pages (including templates) in 12 languages. Perhaps a better choice would be to upload a new image without glowing eyes and name it appropriately, for use in the infobox on 12 pages total. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:58, 1 May 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Because every single use of that image, in both templates and pages, refers to the statue item, which does not have glowing eyes in the Crafting menu, or when it's in the player's inventory, or 99% of the time when it's placed in the world. Which is why I changed the old image and uploaded the previous version under a different name. I fail to see how anything in the images section of Help:Editing is related to this, though I guess I could have added more edit summaries. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Trillian" title="User:Trillian">~trillian</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Trillian&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Trillian (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:05, 1 May 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

I would be happy to do more testing if I could get my hands on a 1.5.6 save file that is progressed further to eliminate that possibility.

A lot of unused code was removed with v1.6, but not all of it.

<p>Hi,
I wonder if you could tell me why my changes I made to the Cherry page are gone?
</p><p>I added a reference to needing dried cherries for the raccoon request. This is helpful if you're trying to decided whether you need a cherry tree or not. I didn't get one because I had already shipped a cherry from my fruit cave and knew it wasn't needed in any recipes. Then I got the raccoon's request for dried cherries which means I needed five and had to buy a sapling and wait.
</p><p>That's info that someone looking up cherries would want to know.
</p><p>Can you tell me why my changes didn't stick?
</p><p>Thanks.

<p>Hey! First off, thank you for your kind message on my talk page, I really appreciate it! Your method of using a program to check the gift tastes was a lot smarter than me just manually checking each line in the gift tastes file, lol.
</p><p>I do have a question regarding Evelyn's gift tastes/quotes, though. I'm running 1.6.8 - she likes Broken Glasses (and has unique dialogue for them), and she likes all beach forage that's not Seaweed (again, with unique dialogue). Item 170 (Broken Glasses) and category forage_item_beach are listed in liked items in <samp>NPCGiftTastes.xnb</samp>, and their quotes are in Evelyn's dialogue file. Did these things get changed in 1.6.9? I wanted to make sure before adding them back to the page.

<p>Hello Margotbean. The furniture named "J" is written as "J Sign" in the wiki. I can understand this change because it's just a one letter name.

<dl><dd>Why can't we have one letter pages though? I'm fine with changing the page as "J (furniture)" or "J (sign)", but its name is "J" in game, so I think it would be better to put exactly like that. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Peaw" title="User:Peaw">Peaw</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Peaw" title="User talk:Peaw">talk</a>) 14:34, 16 June 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's a wiki thing. The body of the page can refer to it as "J" and not "J (sign)", but the page title should definitely be more than one letter. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 15:48, 16 June 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Holy_Blade_Spawn">Holy Blade Spawn</span></h2>
<p>Hello Margotbean! I have never edited a page like this before so I really hope I am doing it correctly! But I discovered some information about the Holy Blade and figured y'all would want to know! I just got two holy blades during a mine run and both of them spawned from defeating special (star antennae) black slimes! Unfortunately, I did not get the floor numbers but one floor was an all green monster room and the other was a normal round room. Both were in the lava, purple earth sections, roughly floors 85-95. Obviously, I don't know if this was pure coincidence or if it is an actual spawn requirement, but I figured it couldn't hurt to share since the wiki page for the Holy Blade is fairly limited. I hope this is helpful to you! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Taypedispenser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Taypedispenser (page does not exist)">Taypedispenser</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Taypedispenser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Taypedispenser (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:22, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Other images for 4 players are named with this format: <code>File:&lt;version&gt;_&lt;farmtype&gt;_close.png</code> or <code>File:&lt;version&gt;_&lt;farmtype&gt;_far.png</code>. The "8p" text only takes part in 8 player images, and 4 player images don't have a "4p" text. <code>separate</code> is for 8 players, and 4 players images use <code>far</code>. So I'd suggest just removing the "4p" part (and change "seperate" in second image) from these images and rename them as <code>1.6 meadow close.png</code> and <code>1.6 meadow far.png</code>.

<dl><dd>Ok, you can find them at <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:1.6_meadow_close.png" title="File:1.6 meadow close.png">File:1.6 meadow close.png</a> and <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:1.6_meadow_far.png" title="File:1.6 meadow far.png">File:1.6 meadow far.png</a>, thanks for your patience! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 16:14, 25 June 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span id="Stacked_Joja_Crates/Boxes"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Stacked_Joja_Crates.2FBoxes">Stacked Joja Crates/Boxes</span></h2>
<p>Hey! I just saw your revision of TITANOBOA's edit on Stacked Joja Crates, but the in-game name <i>is</i> actually "Stacked Joja Boxes". My bad, I think I missed this one when I did the furniture pass-through before. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Bluestblur" title="User talk:Bluestblur">talk</a>) 18:11, 30 June 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>i checked the data files, and didn't see it. Thanks once again for looking out!! XOXOXO <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 23:58, 30 June 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>No problem! It's just a bit weird, since the item ID in <samp>Data/Furniture.xnb</samp> is "StackedJojaCrates", but the name in <samp>Strings/Furniture.xnb</samp> is <samp>"StackedJojaBoxes": "Stacked Joja Boxes"</samp>. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Bluestblur" title="User talk:Bluestblur">talk</a>) 02:10, 1 July 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Maybe someday I will get used to searching for strings without spaces in the name... I dunno. But <code>"StackedJojaCrates": "StackedJojaBoxes/decor/1 2/1 1/1/999/-1/[LocalizedText Strings\\Furniture:StackedJojaBoxes]/67/TileSheets\\joja_furniture/true/collection_joja"</code> is just cruel! Anyway, thanks again for seeing that clearly and communicating with me! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a class="mw-selflink selflink">talk</a>) 18:46, 1 July 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
