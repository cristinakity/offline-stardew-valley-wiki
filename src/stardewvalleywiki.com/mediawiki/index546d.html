:''See also: [[Seed Spot]]''

An '''Artifact Spot''' (also known as '''worms''', '''stems''', or '''twigs''') is a tile that is guaranteed to provide an item when dug up with a [[Hoes|Hoe]] (other tools do not work). Artifact Spots can be found in various tillable (but fallow) tiles on maps all over Stardew Valley (including Ginger Island). Up to 16 can also be created in a given area by using a [[Treasure Totem]].

A variety of location-dependent items can be obtained from artifact spots; they are a key source for [[Artifacts]] and [[Lost Books]]. Artifact spots are much more common in [[Winter]], when they can also yield [[Snow Yam]]s and [[Winter Root]]s.

==Contents==
{{Spoiler}}
{{Stub|Chances need to be updated/confirmed for 1.6}}
The possible contents of an artifact spot are controlled by the map where it is located. The specific item found in any artifact spot is fixed for a given day, even if the game is reloaded.&lt;ref name="contents" /> However, a different item is possible the next day (assuming the artifact spot does not disappear overnight). Using a [[Hoes|Hoe]] with the [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Archaeologist]] enchantment doubles the chance of finding an artifact.

The pool of potential items contained within artifact spots is checked against a list, in the order listed below. The chances to find items later in the list vary depending upon the details of which earlier items still remain possible.
* 20-32% chance of a [[Lost Books|Lost Book]].&lt;ref name="lost_book"/>  Not possible on [[the Farm]]. Note that once all Lost Books are found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by [[Mixed Seeds]].
* Various [[Artifacts]], dependent upon location. Note, however, that some artifacts can never be found in artifact spots (namely, Dwarf Scrolls, [[Dwarvish Helm]], [[Dwarf Gadget]], [[Rare Disc]], and [[Skeletal Tail]]).
* In [[Winter]] only: 28-50% chance of a [[Winter Root]] or a [[Snow Yam]] (Winter Root is 50% more likely than Snow Yam in all locations). Not possible in [[the Desert]].
* During [[Quests#Qi's Crop|Qi's Crop]] quest only: 25% chance of 2-5 [[Qi Bean]]s. If selected, it will continue to produce more drops.
* In [[Spring]] only: 3-6% chance of 1-5 [[Rice Shoot]]s. Not possible in [[the Desert]] or [[The Beach|Beach]].
*2-5 [[Bone Fragment]]s, only during or after completing [[Gunther]]'s Special Order "[[Quests#Fragments of the past|Fragments of the past]]" (20% chance). If selected, it will continue to produce more drops.
* A location-dependent list of other items. Some artifacts can reappear in this second list, but most of the items are resources. The percentages provided are valid for summer and fall (values are generally 50% smaller in winter and 6% smaller in spring).
** 1-3 [[Copper Ore]]: [[Pelican Town]] (14%), [[Railroad]] (11%), [[Bus Stop]] (9%), [[Backwoods]] (7%), [[Cindersap Forest]] (5%), [[the Mountain]]s (5%)
** 1-3 [[Coal]]: [[Backwoods]] (5%), [[the Mountain]]s (4%), [[the Farm]] (4%)
** 1-3 [[Gold Ore]]: [[the Beach]] (4%)
** 1-3 [[Stone]]: possible anywhere (8-20% depending on location)
** 1-3 [[Clay]]: possible anywhere (24-60% depending on location)
** An unseen [[Secret Notes|Secret Note]] or a [[Stone]]: up to 5% chance.&lt;ref name="secret_note" />
** Starting [[Summer]] 1 of Year 1:  1 [[Warp Totem: Farm]], [[Warp Totem: Mountains]], or [[Warp Totem: Beach]] can replace [[Clay]] (10% chance)
* Each Artifact Spot can also spawn (in addition to the above, and in addition to each other):
** 1-2 [[Mystery Box|Mystery Boxes]] (0-11.25% chance depending on [[Luck|daily luck]] after the player has viewed the Mr. Qi plane cutscene)
** A [[Golden Animal Cracker]] (0.8-1% chance depending on [[Luck|daily luck]] after claiming [[Mastery Cave#Masteries|Farming Mastery]]).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
** Either [[Bait And Bobber]], [[Combat Quarterly]], [[Mining Monthly]], [[Stardew Valley Almanac]], or [[Woodcutter's Weekly]] (0.54% chance overall, 0.11% chance to obtain each one).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
** A random cosmetic item (1.8% chance).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
* During the [[Desert Festival]], each artifiact spot will also spawn between 3 and 6 [[Calico Egg|Calico Eggs]].&lt;ref name="desert_festival" />

===On Ginger Island===
On Ginger Island, there are 3 separate attempts to spawn an item from an artifact spot.&lt;ref name="gingerislandall" />
In the first attempt, the game checks through the following items in order, with the final chances as shown:
* 1 [[Golden Coconut]]s (10% after a golden coconut was cracked)
* 2-4 [[Taro Tuber]]s (33%) (29.7% after a golden coconut was cracked)
* 1-2 [[Artifact Trove]]s (10%) (9% after a golden coconut was cracked)

After this it can then spawn the items below, with each check carried out separately, so it can spawn all four.&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
* 1-2 [[Mystery Box|Mystery Boxes]] (0-11.25% chance depending on [[Luck|daily luck]] after the player has viewed the Mr. Qi plane cutscene)
* A [[Golden Animal Cracker]] (0.8-1% chance depending on [[Luck|daily luck]] after claiming [[Mastery Cave#Masteries|Farming Mastery]]).
* Either [[Bait And Bobber]], [[Combat Quarterly]], [[Mining Monthly]], [[Stardew Valley Almanac]], or [[Woodcutter's Weekly]] (0.54% chance overall, 0.11% chance to obtain each one).
* A random cosmetic item (1.8% chance).

Finally, it then goes through a list of possibilties in order, stopping as soon as it generates an item. The list below shows the chance for each item at that step. The actual chance to obtain that item will depend on the chances of the items available before it.&lt;ref name="gingerislandbase" />
* [[Fossilized Ribs]] (10%, only on Island South, only if the island cave has been opened)
* [[Snake Skull]] (10%, Island West only if the island cave has been opened, Island North only if the bridge to the dig site has been fixed)
* [[Snake Vertebrae]] (25%, Island West only if the island cave has been opened)
* 1-4 [[Bone Fragment]]s (25%, Island North only if the bridge to the dig site has been fixed. Number of fragments increases with [[Luck]] and [[Skills#Mining|Mining]] level)
* [[Lost Books|Lost Book]] (20% chance). Note that once all Lost Books are found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by [[Mixed Seeds]].
* [[Qi Bean]]s (During [[Quests#Qi's Crop|Qi's Crop]] quest only 25% chance of 2-5). If selected, it will continue to produce more drops.
* 2-5 [[Bone Fragment]]s (20% chance only during or after completing [[Gunther]]'s Special Order "[[Quests#Fragments of the past|Fragments of the past]]"). If selected, it will continue to produce more drops.
* 1-3 [[Golden Coconut]] (5%)
* 1-3 [[Mahogany Seed]] (5%)
* 1-3 [[Wild Bait]] (10%)
* 1-3 [[Omni Geode]] (100%)

==Spawning==
Overnight, artifact spots randomly spawn in exterior locations at a rate that is highly dependent upon the map.&lt;ref name="day_update" /> Average spawn rates range from 0.1/day ([[Cindersap Forest]], [[Bus Stop]]) to 1/day ([[The Desert|Desert]]). Other than during [[Winter]], artifact spots only appear in tillable soil, ''i.e.,'' yellow/brown tiles that can be tilled with a [[Hoes|Hoe]]. In Winter, the artifact spot spawn rate is higher and they can also appear in grass-type tiles (''i.e.,'' tiles that are colored green during non-winter months; this designation is not based on whether or not harvestable [[Grass]] is growing). Winter-time average spawn rates range from 0.4/day ([[Railroad]]) to 1.4/day ([[The Desert|Desert]]).

Existing artifact spots left in an area overnight block new artifact spots from spawning, according to the following rules:
* Each area is processed independently; for example, an existing artifact spot on the beach has no effect on spawning of other areas (''e.g.,'' the [[Bus Stop]], or [[Cindersap Forest]]).
* Spawning is blocked if there are two or more artifact spots already existing in the same area&lt;ref name="spawnobjects" /> (for [[the Farm]], spawning is blocked if even one exists already).
** In [[Winter]], for all locations, the limit is relaxed. Spawning is no longer blocked unless there are five or more already.
* Spawning is calculated after possible [[#Removal|removal]] of any existing spots, so even when there is an artifact spot left overnight, there is some chance it may be removed and replaced with new spawns.

Artifact spots never spawn in hidden tiles behind buildings, bushes, non-removable trees, or other permanent features. However, they can spawn in difficult-to-see locations behind removable trees (ones the player can chop down). Artifact spots also never spawn in tiles where other objects are present (chests, trees, equipment, weeds, debris, etc.), or in any tilled soil (anywhere a crop is planted or could be planted). Thus, placing equipment or planting trees in tillable soil can reduce the chance of artifact spots spawning, but only if a large fraction of the tiles is occupied.

==Removal==
If the player does not dig up an artifact spot, it is likely to remain in place for multiple days. Normally, there is a 15% chance&lt;ref name="removal" /> of any artifact spot disappearing overnight.

Artifact spots do not get destroyed for reasons other than the player or random removal. For example, [[villagers]] and farm [[animals]] can walk through tiles containing artifact spots without damaging them or otherwise altering them.

Digging up an artifact spot also tills the soil. Off the farm, tilled artifact spots always revert to standard tillable soil overnight.  On the farm, tilled soil typically remains in place until the end of the season. To immediately restore standard tillable soil an [[Axes|Axe]] or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]] must be used on the tile.

==Spawning &amp; Removal Exceptions==
Spawning and removal is accelerated on certain days. By default, the processing for the spawning and removal logic occurs one time each night, except:
* On the first day of the season, processing is repeated twice.&lt;ref name="day_update" /> For most maps, this increases the chances of at least one artifact spot appearing, but for [[Cindersap Forest]], the resulting spawn rate may be actually lower because the effective spawn rate is less than the removal rate of 15%.
* On Sunday, processing is repeated in triplicate.&lt;ref name="day_update" />
* On [[the Beach]], between Summer 12-14, processing is run 6+ times.&lt;ref name="dayupdate_beach" />
* All winter-time artifact spots that spawned on grass-type tiles are always removed at the end of the winter.

==Notes==
* The [[Skills#Foraging|Tracker]] profession can make it easier to find artifact spots, by adding small yellow arrows pointing to any off-screen artifact spots.
* The [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Archaeologist]] enchantment doubles the likelihood of finding an [[Artifacts|artifact]] in an artifact spot.
* The [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Generous]] enchantment gives a 50% chance of a double item from an artifact spot.

==Trivia==
* Many players call them worms, but their internal name is Artifact Spot. An episode of [[Livin' Off The Land]] describes them as "little brown stems":&lt;br />[[File:Artifact Spot Tip.png|580px]]

==References==
&lt;references>
&lt;ref name="contents">The contents of an Artifact Spot are determined by &lt;samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp>, using data from &lt;samp>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/samp> (for artifacts) and &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp> (for extra items). The random number generator is seeded by the save game ID, the days played, and the location. Each item is checked sequentially to see whether a random number is less than the item's specified chance; the first item that succeeds is the one found. One result of this algorithm is that the actual chance of finding a given item is smaller than the value in the input file, because it can only be found if all previous artifacts failed their tests. Extra items are affected the most strongly, because they are checked last, and therefore they are less likely in winter (by 50%) and in spring (by 6.25%).&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="lost_book">All locations (other than the Farm) have a fixed 20% chance of spawning a lost book. Although &lt;samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp> does this check after scanning for artifacts from &lt;samp>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/samp>, a Lost Book overrides any previously-found artifact and therefore is effectively given precedence. Most locations also have a secondary check for a Lost Book based on the data in &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp>.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="day_update">Artifact Spots are spawned and destroyed by &lt;samp>GameLocation::spawnObjects&lt;/samp>. Note that &lt;samp>GameLocation::dayUpdate&lt;/samp> can call &lt;samp>GameLocation::spawnObjects&lt;/samp> multiple times on some days (three calls on Sunday; two calls on first day of the month; two calls on each of first three days of game). Therefore spawn rates and removal rates can be nearly three times faster on some days.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="removal">The removal algorithm is fully random (it does not use a seeded random number generator), so which artifact spots disappear at the end of a day can change if the entire day is replayed.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="secret_note">Once the player has a [[Magnifying Glass]], they have the chance to dig up an unseen [[Secret Notes|Secret Note]]. If the player has seen all possible secret notes, or doesn't have the magnifying glass, or the random check to produce a note fails, they will instead recieve a [[Stone]]. The chance for the random check succeeding and providing a secret note ranges from 12% to 80% depending upon how many notes have been seen, giving a 1.32 to 8.8% chance for this step to give a secret note. See &lt;samp>GameLocation::tryToCreateUnseenSecretNote&lt;/samp> and &lt;samp>DefaultResovlers::SECRET_NOTE_OR_ITEM&lt;/samp> in the game code, and &lt;samp>Data\Locations.xnb&lt;/samp> in the game files.&lt;/ref>
