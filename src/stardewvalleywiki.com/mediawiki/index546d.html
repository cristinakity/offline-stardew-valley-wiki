:''See also: [[Seed Spot]]''

An '''Artifact Spot''' (also known as '''worms''', '''stems''', or '''twigs''') is a tile that is guaranteed to provide an item when dug up with a [[Hoes|Hoe]] (other tools do not work). Artifact Spots can be found in various tillable (but fallow) tiles on maps all over Stardew Valley (including Ginger Island). Up to 16 can also be created in a given area by using a [[Treasure Totem]].

A variety of location-dependent items can be obtained from artifact spots; they are a key source for [[Artifacts]] and [[Lost Books]]. Artifact spots are much more common in [[Winter]], when they can also yield [[Snow Yam]]s and [[Winter Root]]s.

==Contents==
{{Spoiler}}
{{Stub|Add 1.6 drops}}
The possible contents of an artifact spot are controlled by the map where it is located. The specific item found in any artifact spot is fixed for a given day, even if the game is reloaded.&lt;ref name="contents" /> However, a different item is possible the next day (assuming the artifact spot does not disappear overnight). Using a [[Hoes|Hoe]] with the [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Archaeologist]] enchantment doubles the chance of finding an artifact.

The pool of potential items contained within artifact spots is checked against a list, in the order listed below. The chances to find items later in the list vary depending upon the details of which earlier items still remain possible.
* 20-32% chance of a [[Lost Books|Lost Book]].&lt;ref name="lost_book"/>  Not possible on [[the Farm]]. Note that once all Lost Books are found, any potential Lost Book is replaced by [[Mixed Seeds]].
* Various [[Artifacts]], dependent upon location. Note, however, that some artifacts can never be found in artifact spots (namely, Dwarf Scrolls, [[Dwarvish Helm]], [[Dwarf Gadget]], [[Rare Disc]], and [[Skeletal Tail]]).
* In [[Winter]] only: 28-50% chance of a [[Winter Root]] or a [[Snow Yam]] (Winter Root is 50% more likely than Snow Yam in all locations). Not possible in [[the Desert]].
* During [[Quests#Qi's Crop|Qi's Crop]] quest only: 25% chance of 2-5 [[Qi Bean]]s.
* In [[Spring]] only: 3-6% chance of 1-5 [[Rice Shoot]]s. Not possible in [[the Desert]] or [[The Beach|Beach]].
*2-5 [[Bone Fragment]]s, only after completing [[Gunther]]'s Special Order "[[Quests#Fragments of the past|Fragments of the past]]" (20% chance)
* A location-dependent list of other items. Some artifacts can reappear in this second list, but most of the items are resources. The percentages provided are valid for summer and fall (values are generally 50% smaller in winter and 6% smaller in spring).
** 1-3 [[Copper Ore]]: [[Pelican Town]] (14%), [[Railroad]] (11%), [[Bus Stop]] (9%), [[Backwoods]] (7%), [[Cindersap Forest]] (5%), [[the Mountain]]s (5%)
** 1-3 [[Coal]]: [[Backwoods]] (5%), [[the Mountain]]s (4%), [[the Farm]] (4%)
** 1-3 [[Gold Ore]]: [[the Beach]] (4%)
** 1-3 [[Stone]]: possible anywhere (8-20% depending on location)
** 1-3 [[Clay]]: possible anywhere (24-60% depending on location)
** An unseen [[Secret Notes|Secret Note]]: up to 5% chance, only if the player has a [[Magnifying Glass]].&lt;ref name="secret_note" />
** Starting [[Summer]] 1 of Year 1:  1 [[Warp Totem: Farm]], [[Warp Totem: Mountains]], or [[Warp Totem: Beach]] can replace [[Clay]] (10% chance)
* Each Artifact Spot can also spawn:
** A [[Golden Animal Cracker]] (0.8-1% chance depending on [[Luck|daily luck]]).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
** Either [[Bait And Bobber]], [[Combat Quarterly]], [[Mining Monthly]], [[Stardew Valley Almanac]], or [[Woodcutter's Weekly]] (0.54% chance overall, 0.11% chance to obtain each one).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />
** A random cosmetic item (1.8% chance).&lt;ref name="rare_object" />

===On Ginger Island===

==Spawning==
Overnight, artifact spots randomly spawn in exterior locations at a rate that is highly dependent upon the map.&lt;ref name="day_update" /> Average spawn rates range from 0.1/day ([[Cindersap Forest]], [[Bus Stop]]) to 1/day ([[The Desert|Desert]]). Other than during [[Winter]], artifact spots only appear in tillable soil, ''i.e.,'' yellow/brown tiles that can be tilled with a [[Hoes|Hoe]]. In Winter, the artifact spot spawn rate is higher and they can also appear in grass-type tiles (''i.e.,'' tiles that are colored green during non-winter months; this designation is not based on whether or not harvestable [[Grass]] is growing). Winter-time average spawn rates range from 0.4/day ([[Railroad]]) to 1.4/day ([[The Desert|Desert]]).

Existing artifact spots left in an area overnight block new artifact spots from spawning, according to the following rules:
* Each area is processed independently; for example, an existing artifact spot on the beach has no effect on spawning of other areas (''e.g.,'' the [[Bus Stop]], or [[Cindersap Forest]]).
* Spawning is blocked if there are two or more artifact spots already existing in the same area&lt;ref name="spawnobjects" /> (for [[the Farm]], spawning is blocked if even one exists already).
** In [[Winter]], for all locations, the limit is relaxed. Spawning is no longer blocked unless there are five or more already.
* Spawning is calculated after possible [[#Removal|removal]] of any existing spots, so even when there is an artifact spot left overnight, there is some chance it may be removed and replaced with new spawns.

Artifact spots never spawn in hidden tiles behind buildings, bushes, non-removable trees, or other permanent features. However, they can spawn in difficult-to-see locations behind removable trees (ones the player can chop down). Artifact spots also never spawn in tiles where other objects are present (chests, trees, equipment, weeds, debris, etc.), or in any tilled soil (anywhere a crop is planted or could be planted). Thus, placing equipment or planting trees in tillable soil can reduce the chance of artifact spots spawning, but only if a large fraction of the tiles is occupied.

==Removal==
If the player does not dig up an artifact spot, it is likely to remain in place for multiple days. Normally, there is a 15% chance&lt;ref name="removal" /> of any artifact spot disappearing overnight.

Artifact spots do not get destroyed for reasons other than the player or random removal. For example, [[villagers]] and farm [[animals]] can walk through tiles containing artifact spots without damaging them or otherwise altering them.

Digging up an artifact spot also tills the soil. Off the farm, tilled artifact spots always revert to standard tillable soil overnight.  On the farm, tilled soil typically remains in place until the end of the season. To immediately restore standard tillable soil an [[Axes|Axe]] or [[Pickaxes|Pickaxe]] must be used on the tile.

==Spawning &amp; Removal Exceptions==
Spawning and removal is accelerated on certain days. By default, the processing for the spawning and removal logic occurs one time each night, except:
* On the first day of the season, processing is repeated twice.&lt;ref name="day_update" /> For most maps, this increases the chances of at least one artifact spot appearing, but for [[Cindersap Forest]], the resulting spawn rate may be actually lower because the effective spawn rate is less than the removal rate of 15%.
* On Sunday, processing is repeated in triplicate.&lt;ref name="day_update" />
* On [[the Beach]], between Summer 12-14, processing is run 6+ times.&lt;ref name="dayupdate_beach" />
* All winter-time artifact spots that spawned on grass-type tiles are always removed at the end of the winter.

==Notes==
* The [[Skills#Foraging|Tracker]] profession can make it easier to find artifact spots, by adding small yellow arrows pointing to any off-screen artifact spots.
* The [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Archaeologist]] enchantment doubles the likelihood of finding an [[Artifacts|artifact]] in an artifact spot.
* The [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Generous]] enchantment gives a 50% chance of a double item from an artifact spot.

==Trivia==
* Many players call them worms, but their internal name is Artifact Spot. An episode of [[Livin' Off The Land]] describes them as "little brown stems":&lt;br />[[File:Artifact Spot Tip.png|580px]]

==References==
&lt;references>
&lt;ref name="contents">The contents of an Artifact Spot are determined by &lt;samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp>, using data from &lt;samp>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/samp> (for artifacts) and &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp> (for extra items). The random number generator is seeded by the save game ID, the days played, and the location. Each item is checked sequentially to see whether a random number is less than the item's specified chance; the first item that succeeds is the one found. One result of this algorithm is that the actual chance of finding a given item is smaller than the value in the input file, because it can only be found if all previous artifacts failed their tests. Extra items are affected the most strongly, because they are checked last, and therefore they are less likely in winter (by 50%) and in spring (by 6.25%).&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="lost_book">All locations (other than the Farm) have a fixed 20% chance of spawning a lost book. Although &lt;samp>GameLocation::digUpArtifactSpot&lt;/samp> does this check after scanning for artifacts from &lt;samp>ObjectInformation.xnb&lt;/samp>, a Lost Book overrides any previously-found artifact and therefore is effectively given precedence. Most locations also have a secondary check for a Lost Book based on the data in &lt;samp>Locations.xnb&lt;/samp>.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="day_update">Artifact Spots are spawned and destroyed by &lt;samp>GameLocation::spawnObjects&lt;/samp>. Note that &lt;samp>GameLocation::dayUpdate&lt;/samp> can call &lt;samp>GameLocation::spawnObjects&lt;/samp> multiple times on some days (three calls on Sunday; two calls on first day of the month; two calls on each of first three days of game). Therefore spawn rates and removal rates can be nearly three times faster on some days.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="removal">The removal algorithm is fully random (it does not use a seeded random number generator), so which artifact spots disappear at the end of a day can change if the entire day is replayed.&lt;/ref>
&lt;ref name="secret_note">Once the player has a [[Magnifying Glass]], any [[Clay]] found in an artifact spot has a chance of being replaced by an unseen [[Secret Notes|Secret Note]]. If the player has seen all possible secret notes, Clay is found. The chance of being replaced ranges from 1.3% to 9% depending upon how many notes have been seen, see &lt;samp>GameLocation::tryToCreateUnseenSecretNote&lt;/samp> in the game code.&lt;/ref>

==History==
{{History|1.4|Fixed bug causing dry tilled soil left by artifact spots on rainy days. Fixed bug preventing certain artifacts from appearing in artifact spots. Artifact spots on grass now removed at end of winter.}}
{{History|1.5|[[Forge#Tool enchantments|Archaeologist]] and [[Forge#Tool enchantments|Generous]] enchantments added. Warp Totems can now replace Clay.}}
{{History|1.6|[[Treasure Totem]] can now be used to force spawn artifact spots. Added [[Golden Animal Cracker]], skill books, and cosmetic items to possible drops.}}
