<p>Hello!
I have tried to edit the Fish Ponds page to include the  {{name}}  template, however you have reverted this change multiple times because it has to be introduced in all languages at once. This is pretty simple to do if there is a database/page with all the items' translations or a translation module in itself. Could you direct me to one if such exists? 
</p><p>Alternatively, tell me if you think this change better not be made. Thanks

</p>
<dl><dd>Hello again, Artoftheblue! I wish there were a translation db or module, but there is none. Everything has to be done manually. I think the best solution for now is what you did -- create a page in your user space that's formatted the way you prefer. Happy New Year! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:52, 2 January 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hmmmm... I might have a way to do this without a translation module actually as all the pages in other languages have the corresponding names in the same places of the table. Also, is there any other way to contact you/the wiki editors community, like through Discord or are user talks like this the go-to thing? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Artoftheblue&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Artoftheblue (page does not exist)">Artoftheblue</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Artoftheblue" title="User talk:Artoftheblue">talk</a>) 11:17, 3 January 2023 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yeah okay so the main issue is that most languages don't have a page that is updated to version 1.5. I was able to successfully introduce the change in English, German, Russian and Korean, because those pages are updated already. The Chinese page is weird -- although it's updated the latest version, there are some grammar peculiarities that I can't yet understand. Regarding other languages I could either update them now in their current state to follow the format in their current version or someone could notify me when the information about newer features would be added to them and I'll update them then <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Artoftheblue&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Artoftheblue (page does not exist)">Artoftheblue</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Artoftheblue" title="User talk:Artoftheblue">talk</a>) 13:03, 3 January 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Talk pages are definitely the thing to do to communicate about the wiki.</dd>
<dd>When I said "the best solution is ..." I was trying to delicately say it would be better if the change were not made. The name template prevents proper sorting in languages other than English, and I think it makes certain sections of the table less readable. So, I would prefer all languages to remain plain text. The page you created in your user space is just fine, please feel free to continue to edit/change it as you wish.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry I wasn't more clear before, but I want to thank you for your efforts and understanding! <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:29, 3 January 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I just had a look at the Chinese page and there are indeed many grammar related questions (the translation is incomplete). But I still would like to know what "some grammar peculiarities" are?  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Sizau" title="User:Sizau">Sizau</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Sizau" title="User talk:Sizau">talk</a>) 22:24, 10 January 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>If I'm wrong, then Artoftheblue can correct me, but I believe they meant that when using google translate to read Chinese text, the result is a kind of word salad. All the words are there, but in different places than in English. Sometimes there are extra words that don't make sense. It basically means we don't speak or understand the Chinese language, and have to rely on online translators, which don't do a spectacular job of translating. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 00:06, 11 January 2023 (UTC)

<p>Hi! Each <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mobile_Version_History" title="Mobile Version History">release notes</a> section has an intro in the form "<i>Stardew Valley {version} for {platform} was released on {date}</i>". That's duplicated for every version, which makes translation more tedious (and many wikis have patchy translations for it). What do you think of adding a template like <code>{{release notes intro |Android |2023-01-10 |optional announcement link}}</code> which would produce the translated text, so we could just copy the intro to each wiki as-is? —<small><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Pathoschild" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Pathoschild" title="User talk:Pathoschild">talk</a>) 16:48, 10 January 2023 (UTC)</small>
</p>
<dl><dd>Well, I thought about this while I did my daily review of new changes to all the wikis today. My brutally honest thoughts, after some consideration:
<ul><li>It would be <i>a lot</i> of work for you, and it's not strictly necessary</li>
<li>The headings have been unified by a ZH editor in Chinese already, and that's the only language (other than English) that has had any activity by a native speaker in years (literally years)</li>
<li>You would have to choose which translation is the best one, and I'm not aware that you speak all 12 languages (well, the 8 or so that have the page anyway)</li>
<li>If a translator takes an interest in the page, there's a higher than 50% chance they won't understand what a template is, and will delete it, replacing it with plain text/links. Which means that I'll have to either put the template back, or adjust the template's translation to match what the native speaker typed. (More work for me)</li>
<li>A text editor with find/replace can do the same job, and that would probably be what a translator would be more comfortable with (based on my experience).</li>
<li>It would make sense to have the template used on all 3 version history pages (PC, Console, and Mobile), in all languages, so that's even more work (x36), and the PC version history page is kind of a mess in other languages from the hotfix template we created in English. (German still hasn't implemented it, but the page is translated, and I don't speak German, so... there it sits)</li></ul></dd>
<dd>So, while I see where this idea came from, I just really don't want another template to translate and maintain. I know it seems like it would be less work in the end, but my experience says that it will actually be more work, and not a whole lot of payoff. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:07, 10 January 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hello! I was taking a quick peek at the French version of the wiki and noticed a couple tables that had untranslated table headers for recipe tables, but they're just in wikitables sitting on the page, and I couldn't figure out how to get them to work nicely with the Recipes template :( A quick search for "Recipe Source" (on the fr wiki) should point toward the pages/tables in question, I'm just a bit stumped on how to contribute changes to those pages. e.g. on the (english) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Resin#Recipes" title="Oak Resin">Oak Resin#Recipes</a>

</pre>
<p>If I'm understanding this correctly, the Deluxe Speed-Gro's infobox information is getting transcluded into the recipe template/oak resin page?, but the Keg row was just information formatted as a wiki table row within the recipe template, so is fixing those French pages just a matter of doing the latter? If this question doesn't make any sense I can try to explain it, I'm just trying to avoid making any sweeping changes when I don't know what the existing precedent is for this kind of work --<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Hexadecimal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Hexadecimal (page does not exist)">Hexadecimal</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Hexadecimal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Hexadecimal (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 06:40, 12 January 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I think you understand it correctly -- Deluxe Speed-Gro is being transcluded, and the rest is just wikitext added to the table.</dd>
<dd>I found only 6 pages that contain "Recipe Source", so it shouldn't be a huge project to translate the headers using simple wikitext. I had to find the pages with admin tools (the normal search gave too many false results), so I'll give you a list, for convenience:

<p>Hello Margotbean! Thank you for acknowledging my edit. I'll explain the bug I encountered.
</p><p>When I first entered the Forge from ninth floor, I acquired the prismatic shard from the rare chest there. Then I went to sleep and saved the game. However, after I reopened the game the next day and entered the forge from the quick entrance (the entrance that can get you from the start of the volcanic dungeon to the Forge), the rare chest is still there, remaining unopened. I figured out that if I saved the file and reload the game, then the chest will still remain unopened, giving me the opportunity to farm prismatic shards (and also for those who need one lol).
</p><p>Then I finished the volcanic dungeon from 1st floor to 9th floor again, and when I entered the Forge from 9th floor the chest is no longer there. It seems to me now that if players opened the chest and finish the volcano dungeon again, with no reloading save files in the interval, then the chest will disappear.
I wonder if this solves your question.
With regards,

<dl><dd>Hello! The answer to your question depends on your level of experience with computer code, I think. First, try <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Modder_Guide/Get_Started#How_do_I_decompile_the_game_code.3F" title="Modding:Modder Guide/Get Started">decompiling the game code</a>, and look at the methods referenced in the "References" section on the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Artifact_Spot" title="Artifact Spot">Artifact Spot</a> page. #7 is the most appropriate place to start. If you can find <samp>digUpArtifactSpot</samp>, you'll see that an artifact spot should only produce one of item #791 (the Golden Coconut). (If you <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Editing_XNB_files#Unpack_game_files" title="Modding:Editing XNB files">unpack the game files</a>, you'll find the item ID for golden coconut in <samp>Data\ObjectInformation.xnb</samp>.)</dd>
<dd>If all of that works out, then you can start to try to find the source of the extra coconuts.</dd>
<dd>If all of that doesn't work out so well, then I have to put researching it on my "to do" list.</dd>
<dd>If you were using a hoe with the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Forge#Tool_enchantments" title="Forge">Archaeologist enchantment</a>, that would explain one extra coconut, but not a third.</dd>
<dd>Please let me know how this goes. We want the wiki to be accurate!

<p>Hello, I would ask you to reconsider your position on my addition of the "rocks calculation" to the Luck page.
</p><p>Your reasoning is "The page doesn't need to make sense in general"
</p><p>I do believe the purpose of this wiki is to inform the readers, and 99% of the Stardew community has no idea how Luck works, and is not helped by the page.
</p><p>The most important and relevant instance of Luck is in the Mines. You can verify with a Google search or a Reddit search. When people see a good luck day on TV, they head to the mines. It's what most people know Luck for.
</p><p>I believe you are doing the community a disservice by not having the formula for rocks and how luck affects it on the Luck page.
</p><p>Even if that whole page was deleted, and only the one line of calculation was there, I believe it would be more helpful to a reader, that's how important I think it is.
</p><p>Whether you want to reword it, or make a new page which the Luck page references, the luck formula for rocks should be known to the people. Amen.

<dl><dd>Wahoo!! I'm really relieved. <i>Someday</i> when more pressing projects are finished, I'd like to overhaul the villagers' schedules, and that website will be a valuable resource in doing so. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:07, 20 March 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm probably not typical in what I notice in the wiki, but I'll be glad when the schedules project reaches the active stage. It's the single element of the wiki where I consistently find unreliable information, to my continuing disappointment. Earlier on, I tried observing and and carefully documenting what I found, only to have others who claimed to "read the code" replace it less helpful and sometimes incorrect stuff, and it just wasn't my game to track down introduced errors. I have also found that the segments of game code that others have put up for examination only includes timings for when characters *begin* to move from one location to another, never when they *arrive*. Especially in longer walks, those can both be important reference points. So whatever you're planning, I hope it will be more comprehensive than what a decoding can produce.</dd>
<dd>I also dislike the "deviations" technique of presentation. It just makes you have to look two places instead of one. A "deviation" isn't really that, it's just an overriding priority, so one prioritized list ought to work better.</dd>
<dd>Finally, I dislike the headings "before the community center is done" and the "after". Either a player is before or after that milestone. If a character consistently changes behavior after, that complete schedule should be split down the middle "before" and "after", even if some pieces match either way. Seasons are already split this way, and this is the other big piece of schedule (even bigger) that will help reduce complexity inside the detail portions. Otherwise, the lookup process is just a hassle or resolve clearly.</dd>
<dd>Didn't mean to go into such a treatise. I guess I'm more frustrated by schedules than I thought. I hope the thoughts may help with a new plan. I just don't have the energy for that level of cleanup any more. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Giles" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Giles" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:19, 25 March 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I definitely appreciate the feedback! I am frustrated by the state of villager schedules, and have been for about 6 years now. I agree, the "deviations" section is not the best way to present info; I'd like to get rid of it and integrate deviations into the main schedules.</dd>
<dd>Sometime in 2020 or so, I stalked Sebastian for several weeks (real time), because his schedule file is the most confusing. I found that his actual behavior deviated from the schedule file, because it took him longer to walk from his bedroom to the kitchen than expected. The schedule file assumed it took maybe 20 in-game minutes, when it took 30-40 (or something similar). Therefore, he reached the kitchen later, stayed for one 10-minute tick of the clock, then returned to his bedroom. I learned then that the schedule file is not the ultimate guide it ought to be.</dd>
<dd>Someday I will have all other more pressing projects done, and I'll be able to fix schedules. Someday... someday... someday... *sigh*</dd>
<dd>Again, I will take your comments into account.

<p><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a>  It seems you're trying to maintain "total editorial control" over the content here, as though this were official documentation (rather than community). Have you considered software specifically designed for that scenario, rather than wiki software? Where I work there is a ton of official documentation where we need to guarantee quality for the reader. Publication can be controlled Git, combined with DocFX (there are similar technologies as well). Given how you run things, I suspect this would make your life much, much, much easier and is a better fit for what you're trying to accomplish. The flow requires contributors to do a "pull request", whereupon it can be discussed/approved/rejected. You would no longer be on the hook to "react" to changes made in the visible articles, since the pull request requires your approval before any change is made. This is vital to maintain one's sanity. Seriously, I can't believe you actually watch the page all day and react to everything. Impressive and dedicated, yes, but if I'm being honest, it's quite stifling. I feel like I'm trying to contribute to "your" documentation project.
</p><p>You could probably continue with the wiki approach if you really want to, but at the very least I would advise canonizing a lot of your opinions into the Help:Editing section, so that people know what to expect. For example, wikis typically need to repeat information in multiple pages for ease of reading, but you would prefer to have each fact presented only in a single article (presumably for maintainability/translation reasons), and this may be another sign this wiki may have graduated a public editing stage, and is instead more of an official docs site. I was also confused as to why we're not allowed to guide the player in any way. Seems inconsistent, as tons of pages on this site offer various "advice" and "tips" that help new players understand the thinking of a more seasoned player. Whatever the scope of the documentation (be it "fact dump" or "Helpful tips"), the intended scope should be explained somewhere. Canonizing those expectations fosters discussion on the guidelines. I'm sure some people want the "facts", other folks want help playing the game, or there may be other viewpoints that we don't know.
</p><p>In any case, I'd never have expected to see such pushback on me cleaning up 5-year old articles that seem abandoned and uncared for. At least on the articles I'm editing, so far I am seeing very little community involvement, it just seems like you locking it down "because no one had a problem with it before". You're likely to push away your average wiki contributor this way, but I suspect that's intentional given the scope of expectations you want to maintain regarding the 12 languages. I appreciate the scope of this undertaking, but it is not really a wiki at this point, so I can't really fulfill any of my visions and there doesn't seem to be much community on the older pages either, so I'll probably try bringing the Fandom Stardew Wiki up to speed instead. Good luck!

<dl><dd>I'm not margotbean, but your concern is entirely irrelevant. First, you can change your own according to your user page or build your own wiki to your vision and let the public decide which one is better, it's a philosophical talk which have relative right or wrong.

<dl><dd>Well, welcome to the wiki! The problem with the edit was chiefly that it needs to be applied to all affected animals' pages, not just the chicken. So, if you're willing to add a section about animal care &amp; friendship to all farm animals' pages, then we can discuss the specifics. Are you up for editing several pages? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:21, 27 April 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Well, I could have written a note on your talk page to explain things a little more, so don't worry. To be honest, my mind is a bit blown that there isn't already an "Animal Care" section on the farm animals' pages. They may have been a bit neglected in this regard.</dd>
<dd>The good news is that once you have the section written, most of it can be copy/pasted to the other animals' pages with only a few changes. It might be a good idea to put it on your <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Mortician_Technician" title="User:Mortician Technician">user page</a> first, then tweak it until it's right.

<dl><dd>Hello Stardude, nice to see you again. I'm afraid I don't have any advice for you. The Statue of Perfection duplication glitch is the biggest money maker I've found, and you're already using it. As for optimal money farm layout images: no. I'm sorry, but the things that make the most money are a subject of debate, and the wiki strives to be an objective resource.

<p>hi Margotbean, regarding my reverted edit today on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leo" title="Leo">Leo</a>'s "likes", here's how i read it:
</p>
<ul><li>original: "All Universal Likes (except Beer, Coffee, Life Elixir, Mead, Pale Ale, Pickles, Piña Colada, Wine, and Cooking other than Bread, Fried Egg, Poi, Mango Sticky Rice, &amp; Triple Shot Espresso)"</li>
<li>rephrased: "He likes everything, EXCEPT for cooking which he doesn't like, EXCEPT for espresso which he does like"</li></ul>
<p>...and that's incorrect, he doesn't like espresso, he hates it. the only thing in the list of "exceptions to not liking cooking" that he likes is mango sticky rice. i think my original edit was correct? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Cooperka" title="User:Cooperka">Cooperka</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Cooperka" title="User talk:Cooperka">talk</a>) 16:12, 10 May 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Well, all villagers' pages are written the same way; that is, an exception to an exception means we don't know how they feel about the item, just that it's an exception to the rule. So, Leo doesn't necessarily like any of the listed cooked dishes, it's just that they don't follow the rule that "Leo doesn't like cooking". Basically it means "do more research before gifting these items". I know it can be a mind-bender.  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:00, 10 May 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>it makes sense that a <b>regular</b> exception means "we don't know how they feel, so do more research before gifting", but an exception to an exception should mean something different than that, shouldn't it? i looked through every villager page and i'd like to hear your thoughts on the list below. there are only a few villagers who have double-negated entries, and most of the entries are written "correctly" from my perspective, with only a few exceptions in parentheticals below:</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Sebastian" title="Sebastian">Sebastian</a> - universal likes except Artisan Goods, but still likes Coffee &amp; Green Tea (so i think we should just remove Oil from the exceptions to not liking Artisan Goods because, <b>as expected</b>, he doesn't "like" Oil. Oil is <b>not</b> an exception to his "not liking Artisan Goods", it actually follows the rule, so there's no need to name it. otherwise, we would need to enumerate the entire set of Artisan Goods -- for example, why isn't Honey listed there too?)</li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Jas" title="Jas">Jas</a> - universal likes except Artisan Goods, but still likes Honey &amp; Jelly (so i think we should remove Oil)</li>

<dl><dd>Thank you for the link. I can sense that I'm bothering you, so let me cut to a simpler question to resolve this because I'm just looking for an explanation. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bread" title="Bread">Bread</a> is a universal Neutral; Leo is Neutral to Bread; Leo Dislikes most Cooking except for a few things including Bread, and the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/List_of_All_Gifts" title="List of All Gifts">List of All Gifts</a> describes this perfectly for Leo; but <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Leo#Like" title="Leo">Leo's "Likes"</a> section explains that he does not Like Cooking, and Bread is an exception to his not Liking Cooking. If you can help me understand why Bread belongs here even though he doesn't Like it, that's all I'm trying to understand. <b>Nothing about Bread is unusual for Leo</b>, it's a universal Neutral, yet it's explicitly called out in his Likes. Why? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Cooperka" title="User:Cooperka">Cooperka</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Cooperka" title="User talk:Cooperka">talk</a>) 14:10, 11 May 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's because bread is an exception to "All cooking". Again, if you're thinking that Leo doesn't like bread, you must do more research to see how he feels about it. What the page says is that it's an exception to his not liking "All cooking". That's it, that's the answer. It's an exception to "all cooking".</dd>
<dd>It ends up being that a double negative cancels out, and Leo doesn't like Bread, or, I should say, he's neutral towards it. But I only know that because I've checked universal gifts first, and Leo's other gifting sections. I know the gifting sections are confusing, but I don't know how I can explain it in a different way. Really, my point is that they're all written the same way, in 12 languages, and they're all equally confusing/clear. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:47, 11 May 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>In the game code, there's no "yellow slime", they're all variations of green slimes. So, the title of the image (uploaded in 2016) describes the appearance without delving into the game code. The understanding that yellow slimes are actually green slimes came after the image was uploaded.</dd>

<p>Hey MargotBean, Stardude here. I just have a small suggestion, it’s hard to search for glitches on the wiki, so why don’t you guys/girls/other add a glitches/bugs page, it would list the current known glitches in the game without the struggle of scouring the Internet to find them. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Stardude" title="User:Stardude">Stardude</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Stardude" title="User talk:Stardude">talk</a>) 4:15 13 June 2023 (UTC)

<p>Just to let you know, I had another oddity occur today, and may have uncovered the source of all the happenings. I seem to have missed a Steam client update earlier.

<p>Hi Margotbean, I ran a perfection playthrough to update the routing images since the ones on here are only for V 1.4, however I'm not someone that knows how to format or code and don't want to break the wiki. I was wondering if there was a way I could get assistance adding the pictures in a new section underneath the 1.4 images? I don't want to replace them since people still run older versions, just wanted to contribute with Leo/Ginger Island/shortcuts added in. (If this is the right place for assistance I can link my Reddit post where I have the photos and description of the run and possible issues there may be with the pathing)

<dl><dd>Hello Mookie! New users cannot post external links, but if you leave me a message containing  everything after <code>https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley</code> I can find the post and take a look. If there are v1.5 images, the existing images should be updated. The older versions can always be found by clicking on the image, which takes you to the file page, where all versions are kept. But I'll know more after I see what we're talking about.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thank you Mookie! I've taken a look, and I think we need to update some images and link to the reddit post.

<dd>We should probably keep the link to the v1.4 images, since they include the interiors of villagers' homes (if for no other reason).</dd>
<dd>Give me some time to work out the details. (I also have some concerns about the recent reddit protest, and don't want the post to become impossible to see, once we've added the link on the wiki.)</dd>

<dl><dd>OK, I've been comparing the 1.4 and 1.5 images. There are some updates to be made! Unfortunately, I cannot download the full size images from reddit in .png format, only .webp format, and I cannot upload .webp images to the wiki.</dd>
<dd>Also, the Pelican Town image seems to be missing Shane's path to work, before the movie theater is built. I would like to upload the Bus Stop and Mountain images today, but the .webp format is a problem. What I can do is add a link to the reddit post, so at least that will be on the page. If you would consider moving the entire image gallery to imgur.com, I could download .png format (or .jpg if the file size is really large). It's your choice. For now, I will add the link to the updated images.

<p>Hi Margotbean. I made an edit to the descriptions that state the Quarry has to be unlocked for the Dungeon Floors to appear in the regular mines making it to read that the [Quarry Mines] would need to be unlocked for these floors to appear in the regular mines. My edit was reversed, but is actually fact. These dungeon floors will NOT appear in the regular mines if that Quarry Mine has not been unlocked. I know this from playing the game across many save files and experimenting with this. I purposely do not unlock the Quarry Mines and never get those dungeon floors. If I do go into the Quarry Mines and unlock it then those floors do randomly appear in my regular mines. I do unlock the actual Quarry area on every save, just not that mine that is called the Quarry Mine. The Quarry area only needs to be unlocked to gain access to that Mine, but the Mine has to be unlocked to get those dungeon floors added in the regular mines. Thank you.

<p>Hi Margotbean. Regarding the wiki Children page / Stages, I added to the Stage 2 area that the interaction of tossing the stage 2 child while sleeping (that created a spinning caterpillar effect) was actually removed in version 1.4, this based on information I had found on the SDV reddit and based on my own game play. I remember being able to do this but it hasn't been possible since 1.4, if you want to look into adding a code for it.
[Stage 2
14 days long. When interacting with the child, the player will toss them into the air, which improves the relationship level. Tossing the child while sleeping for a humorous animation was removed in v1.4].

<dl><dd>Yes, I saw that, I've been trying to research it in the game code for about 3 hours.

<dl><dd>There are so few discussions about templates, anywhere is fine. Here on my talk page is good. 👍</dd>
<dd>It's funny, I was just looking at <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Category:Special_items" title="Category:Special items">Category:Special items</a> a couple of days ago and thinking "Should I make a navbox for these?" The problem is, if we break "special items" up into sub-categories (like "wallet items"), then we have to change the category on the page, and I can't accurately translate "Wallet items" in all 12 languages. If we made a "Special Items" navbox, then the category could stay the same, but clicking on "Category:Special items" accomplishes the same goal.</dd>
<dd>So, translating the categories is the problem with making a navbox. If you just make a "Wallet items" navbox, then the category has to be "Wallet items" for all those items' pages, and it has to be translated in 12 languages. It would be nice to do in only English &amp; Turkish, but I can't do that. I'm desperately trying to keep all 12 language wikis somewhat the same. It's a losing battle, but I have to keep trying.</dd>
<dd>I'm open to any solutions you have! And, as always, I admire your energy and commitment to making the wiki better.

<dl><dd>I think you are right then. Clicking on the category name - clicking on the navbox, same things!

<dl><dd>The change has been discussed at length in the past and rejected.

<dl><dd>Why has it been rejected? It makes the table much more readable. "Other language versions will be outdated" is not a reason to stop updating and improving the English wiki. It simply means the other language versions will need to be updated later. - <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Starfarmer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Starfarmer (page does not exist)">Starfarmer</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Starfarmer" title="User talk:Starfarmer">talk</a>) 18:16, 25 September 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm afraid that's not how it works. Changes which prevent proper alphabetical sorting in other languages are not good changes, and making things excessively difficult for other languages is not very nice.

I've added xp per day to the crops section. I believe this is important if you want to level up your farming or foraging skills to access certain recipee faster (in my case, I need to get to level 6 farming to get quality sprinkler to automate my farm).
I've added all explanation on the page and also inputting all xp per day valye. Interestingly, poppy flower became the fastest way to farm xp but only yield 5g/day. Blueberry attractiveness also severely affected since you only gained xp on first product in each harvest.

<p>Hi there Margot, my name is Jack - I'm a developer and avid community member. Recently a friend and I developed stardew.app (can't link externally, but that's the website), which is an A-Z 100% perfection checklist tool. It allows users to upload their save files, manually update values, and login with Discord so their data is saved across platforms. It's not necessarily a competitor at all to Stardew Checkup but a more fully fledged checklist system for things that players might be missing. I initially created it because I couldn't find a comprehensive and easy to use spreadsheet as I played through my perfection run, so I decided to create one. The code is also completely open source on GitHub and deployed from the repository as a method of trust for our community. I've spent a lot of time building this tool with my friend and as someone who greatly benefits from it I'd really love it if it was shared officially as a resource on the wiki. We are listed as a third-party resource in the SDV official Discord, and they sent me here to ask you about getting it added to the home page. If you have any questions, my Discord username is @lafond. Thank you so much!

<p>Hello again :) Thanks for fixing up my last edit. I noticed Friendship, Fiber Seeds, and Catfish were changed to be capitalized. In the spirit of reducing the work you or anyone else has to do when I edit the wiki, is there a Manual of Style or similar that details guidelines for capitalization and the like? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:IntricateSpiral&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:IntricateSpiral (page does not exist)">IntricateSpiral</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:IntricateSpiral&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:IntricateSpiral (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:59, 25 October 2023 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>No official style guide as of yet. One thing to remember is that all similar pages should read the same, <i>e.g.,</i> all random quests from the help wanted board across all pages. So, a change to one means a change to them all. As for capitalization, it tends to be a personal preference and is not currently standardized. My preference would be not to go out of one's way to un-capitalize items that are capitalized in-game (including seasons), even though they aren't proper nouns outside the game.</dd>

<p>Hi Margotbean! I agree with your Relationship reversal, removing the blurb contained in his Zero Heart event, based on (Linus cutscene not really an indicator of relationship w/Gus). I would also question other changes such as <i>"spends <b>most</b> of his time in and around his <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tent" title="Tent">tent</a>"</i> since he spends most of his time outside the Spa in Fall and inside the Spa in Winter, but also travels to the west and southwest sides of the Lake during Spring and Summer. I wouldn't consider these areas exactly being <i>around</i> his tent and think the line was originally meant to just say he won't be at Ginger Island, requiring the schedules to be checked for other locations. Maybe "in the Mountain area" would be a better description? I also think North of Pelican Town near the Mines was a cleaner more precise way of stating his location (since most players learn early on where the Mines are located). Sometimes trying to elaborate can cause confusing information.

<dl><dd>Well, thank you for the kind words! (Despite my copious typos and ability to slaughter edits with a mouse cursor that has started jumping around due to a hole in my tablecloth recently...)</dd>
<dd>A lot of the sections on villagers' pages date back to the days when Stardew was first released. Before anyone had unpacked the game files, no one knew anyone's exact schedule, and generalizations were more important. The section could be edited down, in my opinion. But the changes you suggest seem fine, especially given the supporting evidence you've cited. (Please let's not bring up Linus looking into the windows of the spa, though! Let's just not go there.) So, go ahead and seize the day. (Yes, I said that. I'm sorry.) <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:30, 25 October 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Perfect! I was consulting with a fellow player how best to word any changes and hadn't had time to make them yet. Also, "generally considers himself" is much more appropriate than stating he <i>is</i> an outcast. He lives this way by choice, after all. As always, you made the best change.

<p>I'm a long time player of the game, and as a frequent user of the wiki I can't help but notice certain pages tend to get edited more than others. The golden scythe being one of them. I didn't want to just immediately start making edits as a new account though, as I feel that would be overstepping. But I do have some input on it, as I believe (and have noticed) the edit in particular is due to a very common myth about this item. It does NOT actually have a wider range than the regular scythe. This fact is relatively easy to check, and I also recorded myself doing so for a bit and uploaded it to streamable. (unfortunately I can't place external links here, as I just found out trying to to add this topic)
All things considered this is relatively unimportant distinction for the game as a whole, but 'what does the golden scythe do?' is a relatively common question both on the subreddit, and the discord. As such the information about it's range has become quite widespread and is difficult to combat due to the wiki's insistence that it's true. Given that you're the most recent edit to this page, and the prior edit had actually removed this information, I assume that you are someone who believes in its extended range. So I'm hoping that by showing you the video it might lean towards the page having the correct information more often than not given that you're one of the primary mods of the wiki as a whole. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:VinylScratch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:VinylScratch (page does not exist)">VinylScratch</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:VinylScratch&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:VinylScratch (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:25, 4 November 2023 (UTC)

<p>Sorry you didn't like my structural changes, Margotbean. I didn't consider the re-leveling to be a major change, or I would have done differently. I also disagree with you that the old structure is fine. I attempted what I considered a light fix to make things clearer, but I find the organization to be confusing. Perhaps it's just that other sections need rewriting also, but it's hard to say. It's not always clear how what is being said applies to the variety of slimes involved. Be that as it may, it's probably best to let things lie until 1.6 is well under weigh.

<dl><dd>Thanks for the understanding, Giles. I appreciate that you've been with the wiki almost as long as I have, and you've gained wisdom about the wiki that I value very much.</dd>
<dd>I can't properly express my level of stress about the upcoming changes. But, I think that after a major update, page reorganization would be much more appropriate. I'm thinking of the 11 other languages, and the changes needed there to catch up to the English wiki. After a major release, more editors will be active in the other languages, and more people to update the other wikis to match. Anyway, I do value your input and especially your understanding about this set of edits.

I certainly don't want to be disruptive in such a high-intensity time. And I recognize and value your contributions here greatly. In addition to all the improvements and updates, you also preserve good work done in the past from all the different types of trolls. Good quality is always high maintenance. All the best to you in the 1.6 efforts! Juggling the languages has to be a monumental task!

<p>I noticed a few of your actions, e.g. the deletion of the quality page or the edit you repeatedly reverted on <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cauliflower" title="Cauliflower">Cauliflower</a>, cited in their summary that the information was "redundant" or "already covered elsewhere", and I'm trying to understand why that's a problem. In my experience, some redundancy is inevitable with the sharing of useful information, and obviously there are central pages like the Crops page that provide information which you could also get from the individual pages. What's the difference there? 
</p><p>I'm partly asking because I would like to create a page for item quality, and would prefer not to have to redirect to the Crop Quality section of the Crops page, which is the only other place I see the Item Quality mechanic summarized (and not everything is a crop, so that feels out of place). I'm also wondering what you think of my own addition to <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Cauliflower" title="Cauliflower">Cauliflower</a> (this being an example of where Quality page might be useful; I admit, however, that I forgot to preview my edit because I assumed quality would exist).

<dl><dd>Well, I'm sure you wouldn't want me to waste my time explaining past edits and reversions over again, so I'm not sure exactly what your question is. You want to create a page that was already rejected, but without wasting time on it.

<dl><dd>I am asking why the page was rejected, so that I don't contribute something that isn't wanted (this would've been a better way to put it than "waste my time", sorry for the tone. Though if I may say, I don't think explaining oneself is ever a waste of time, as long as the listener is receptive). The deletion log only says "Info is covered on individual pages", which doesn't make much sense to me, unless this was elaborated on somewhere. Regardless of the exact reason, I think "quality" seems like a keyword describing a mechanic, and that keywords should have their own articles, separate from the individual pages affected by the mechanic the keyword describes. It's not like it's a minor mechanic. It affects gifting, sale prices, and there are many ways it can be increased (e.g. fertilizer in the case of crops or annually in the case of fruit trees), that seems worth explaining in one place. However, you seem to disagree (rather strongly, based on this interaction thus far, though my poor choice of words did not help), and I want to know why. --<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Twisted_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Twisted Code (page does not exist)">Twisted Code</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Twisted_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Twisted Code (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:01, 23 December 2023 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>You know, it's amazing what a bit of rest can do for one's understanding of a problem. I think I may have been focusing too hard on that specific deleted page. While, yes, I would say I have rather strong feelings that <b>Quality</b> eould be useful, and I'd like for you to see the potential I see, I think it's more important for me to get a general understanding of what sorts of broader wiki improvements would be acceptable. I normally, when I edit wikis, stick to mostly basic stuff like copyediting the grammar and (if need be) spelling, but sometimes I might want to improve a wiki in broader strokes. Does Wikipedia's "be bold" apply to this site, or to what extent should I beholding off and waiting for some form of greenlight (and what would constitute a greenlight per this wiki's governance)?--<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User:Twisted_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Twisted Code (page does not exist)">Twisted Code</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Twisted_Code&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Twisted Code (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 15:58, 24 December 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Most of what you seek can be found by reading <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>. What that page doesn't say is that there is a major game release (version 1.6) coming soon, with added content and multiple code changes, so any major (and even some more minor) structural or formatting changes to the wiki are on hold until after that chaos is over. Opening a discussion on a talk page about proposed changes is still a-ok, however. I hope this helps. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:36, 24 December 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I am theValiantSun, one of the admins for the Stardew Valley Speedrun community. We were wondering if it would be possible/allowed to add some pages to the Wiki which would contain information about the speedrun community (namely some basic rules and FAQ) which are currently only accessible through the Discord. While creating our own independent wiki could also make sense, we thought that it would be worth asking about since the modding community also lives on this wiki and we believe that speedrunning is a valuable part of the game's community. 
</p><p>Currently, the Speedrun Community has over 2,000 followers and 790 players on SRC and our Discord has over 2,000 members. Speedrunning the game has recently been featured at large scale charity events including Awesome Games Done Quick 2023. We believe that this community has the opportunity to grow should the information be more readily available to other people. 
</p><p>We understand that maintenance of pages can be a chore and (as such) have a small team of admins (including potentially familiar names such as Bla_De and Underscore) who have agreed to help with upkeep of these new pages. Related to another post I saw, we also have some admins who are experts on glitches (which is a category of the game) who has volunteered to help upkeep such a page if there is interest for it. 
</p><p>Thank you for your time!

<dl><dd>Hello ValiantSun! Thank you for your well thought-out and persuasive comment.</dd>
<dd>You should know, however, that I was strongly opposed to adding the modding section to the wiki in the first place. I was overruled by the Chucklefish Admin at the time, and so the wiki has a modding section. I still think it belongs on its own separate wiki, to be brutally honest. I would be happy to link to it, and to a speedrunning wiki, if one exists, but I don't think it belongs on the wiki itself. I'm terribly sorry, it's not a reflection on the speedrunning community or speedrunning itself.
