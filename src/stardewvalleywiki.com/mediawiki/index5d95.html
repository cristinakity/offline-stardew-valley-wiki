== Melon Meteor ==
So I don't really know what I'm doing but I just had the oddest event happen... I woke up looking for a meteor strike and when I found it it was a melon meteor? (melonite?) Also, I don't know how to add photos so if this doesn't show up please help me

''image removed by admin''

Update: It was broken with an axe hit and released 21 melons, I'll keep posting if this happens again
{{clear}}
:It's a Giant Melon. Not part of the Random Events logic. See [[Crops#Giant_Crops]]. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 17:19, 30 March 2021 (UTC)

== Strange Capsule ==
The page currently says "Once this event has happened once in a save file, it cannot happen again." However, this event has happened to me twice on the same save. Has this happened to anyone else? [[User:Cygnus|Cygnus]] ([[User talk:Cygnus|talk]]) 14:34, 2 April 2021 (UTC)
:There have been reports of it on the wiki, but the game code should prevent it.  Are you using the latest version of the game?  What platform are you playing on?  If you have found 2+ Strange Capsules with the latest version, and are not playing on mobile, this needs to be reported on the [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/forums/help-bug-reports.12/ Official forums] as a bug. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:21, 2 April 2021 (UTC)
::I recently had a message in the morning like when a Strange Capsule spawns, but I already had one. When I checked my Farm (wich is very tidy so it is impossible to not find anything) I found no Strange Capsule and also no meteorite or Stone Owl. I didn't look inside the code for that but I guess the Game checks having one after 'hearing' the strange noise and before spawning it. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 22:44, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
::If I am right, Cygnus maybe just saw the message but not the Capsule itself. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 22:46, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
:::Oh, that's interesting.  Let's keep an eye out for that happening, so we can report the bug!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:13, 4 April 2021 (UTC)
::::I'm playing on PC, and I believe it happened a couple weeks after 1.5 was released. And I didn't just see the message again, I have two capsule items. [[User:Cygnus|Cygnus]] ([[User talk:Cygnus|talk]]) 00:55, 6 April 2021 (UTC)
:::::That's so because the Capsule can only spawn once per safefile since 1.5.3. In 1.5 It was possible to have more than 1. [[User:Botautal|Botautal]] ([[User talk:Botautal|talk]]) 11:53, 6 April 2021 (UTC)
::::::It was interesting to see that you're only supposed to have this event happen once. I had it happen twice on one file, presumably before 1.5.3, and then a third time afterward.

== Strange Capsule on Ginger Island ==
Had the strange capsule event trigger while sleeping on Ginger Island. Went back home the next day and found the capsule landed behind my mill. I've edited the article to reflect this behavior, but I'm curious if anyone else has had this happen, or if it's supposed to work this way according to CA?

[[User:Asphodel|Asphodel]] ([[User talk:Asphodel|talk]]) 00:39, 2 May 2021 (UTC)

:Events occur naturally on the Farm, even if you are on the Ginger Island. [[User:JaksStrange|JaksStrange]] ([[User talk:JaksStrange|talk]]) 00:51, 2 May 2021 (UTC)

== Stone Owl ==
I got the stone owl in winter of year one, about a couple days after night market. the page currently says that it has the same conditions as the strange capsule, which would mean it could only show up after year one. am i just misreading, is it a bug, or is info about the stone owl wrong? [[User:Red Panda|Red Panda]] ([[User talk:Red Panda|talk]]) 15:23, 23 February 2022 (UTC)

:The page does not say it can only show up after year one because that is not what "same conditions" refers to. It is intended to be able to show up on year one as well. Perhaps that should be clarified. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 17:53, 23 February 2022 (UTC)

== Meteor Location ==
I don't think the logic for the meteor's position is correct. The page states, the game chooses a random 3x3 square, then checks for a suitably-clear 2x2 square within that. However I had the meteor event, reloaded from the day before, and experimented with obstacles: anything within the *3x3* square prevented the meteor from landing. (Obstacles around the 3x3 square didn't block it, but anything inside did, even if not on the 2x2 square the meteor chose.) [[User:Lchu|Lchu]] ([[User talk:Lchu|talk]]) 13:28, 26 October 2022 (UTC)
:You might be right, I don't know. The relevant code is &lt;samp>Events.SoundInTheNightEvent&lt;/samp>. I don't have time to step through the code atm, but I will copy it here:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C#">
  targetLocation = new Vector2(r.Next(5, f.map.GetLayer("Back").TileWidth - 20), r.Next(5, f.map.GetLayer("Back").TileHeight - 4));
  for (int i = (int)targetLocation.X; (float)i &lt;= targetLocation.X + 1f; i++)
  {
    for (int j = (int)targetLocation.Y; (float)j &lt;= targetLocation.Y + 1f; j++)
    {
      Vector2 v = new Vector2(i, j);
      if (!f.isTileOpenBesidesTerrainFeatures(v) || 
          !f.isTileOpenBesidesTerrainFeatures(new Vector2(v.X + 1f, v.Y)) || 
          !f.isTileOpenBesidesTerrainFeatures(new Vector2(v.X + 1f, v.Y - 1f)) || 
          !f.isTileOpenBesidesTerrainFeatures(new Vector2(v.X, v.Y - 1f)) || 
          f.doesTileHaveProperty((int)v.X, (int)v.Y, "Water", "Back") != null || 
          f.doesTileHaveProperty((int)v.X + 1, (int)v.Y, "Water", "Back") != null)
      {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }&lt;/syntaxhighlight>
:I don't know offhand what the standard TileWidth is, and that's preventing me from analyzing this code snippet. Any insights are welcome! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:07, 26 October 2022 (UTC)
::TileWidth and TileHeight are both 64, which means the Meteorite only spawns on the left approx. half of the farm (not sure if this is intentional or not). But it's not important for Lchu's point - targetLocation is the coordinates the meteor will spawn, and is only set on that line, so the wiki was indeed wrong. [[User:Wikonimo|Wikonimo]] ([[User talk:Wikonimo|talk]]) 21:26, 20 May 2024 (UTC)

== Crop fairy glitch ==

I was playing crop fairy random seed and i planted 24 wild seeds and one parsnip seed in centre to make 5x5 patch for crop fairy. Next day parsnip was fully grown but wild seeds were showing their first day seedlings(even though they were fully grown too) . Anyway while harvesting  all seeds i leveled up my farming instead of foraging. I tried on a new save file and found same results. If i am not wrong than they were giving farming xp instead of foraging. Also wild crop was wild headashros (or whatever its name is) instad of being random [[User:Void farmer|Void farmer]] ([[User talk:Void farmer|talk]]) 20:26, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

I was right i got 176 points in total which are 8 for parsnip and 7 points for 24 wild hashedroses
8+7*24=176
If someone want to verify it here is the random seed :
269733094 crop fairy day 3 [[User:Void farmer|Void farmer]] ([[User talk:Void farmer|talk]]) 20:36, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

:You may have missed some important details, because I used that random seed, and no crop fairy showed up. Please report bugs on [https://forums.stardewvalley.net/ the official forums], include the platform, version, and language you're playing on, and a developer may be able to figure it out and fix it. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:10, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

::The main thing was the farmin xp gained from foragables. The random seed was just to check weather the glitch works or not and can be checked during normal gameplay if someone lucky enough to predict crop fairy next day. Anyway these are other seeds i know but i am not sure that they will work when the previous one did not worked(did you really used previous random seed and placed at least one parsnip seed to ensure crop fairy will arrive on 3rd spring). In this seeds u get crop fairy on 1st night so u have to use any mod or item spawn glitch to get wild spring seeds. Please please check it. 270192222 [[User:Void farmer|Void farmer]] ([[User talk:Void farmer|talk]]) 21:52, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

:::I have not heard of [[Crafting#Seeds|Wild Seeds]] giving farming XP instead of foraging XP, this is why you need to report bugs on the forums, not the wiki. Many people (including developers) check the forums for such odd behaviors, and can offer explanations. 
:::Wild seeds spawned from the CJB item spawner don't always behave the same way as vanilla Wild Seeds, so they can't be used in testing. Good luck on the forums! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:50, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

== Meteorites got an upgraded drop pool in 1.6 ==

The meteorite now drops 10 iridium ore, 8 stone, 2 omni geodes, and a prismatic shard
[[User:LuntaTWM|LuntaTWM]] ([[User talk:LuntaTWM|talk]]) 22:21, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
:Can confirm, I had the same experience when breaking open two of them today. Two shiny prismatic shards plus the other items, one shard from each. [[User:Redwood|Redwood]] ([[User talk:Redwood|talk]]) 13:12, 26 March 2024 (UTC)
