  Hi, My name is ''Katze'' But you can call me ''Mortician Technician''.
       I enjoy drawing, listening to music, riding horses, and well, playing Stardew valley!




==Chicken==
:::: Having a good bond with your chickens is crucial to having a supply of quality eggs. A Good way to do so is by regularily petting your chickens, This raises your [[Friendship]] up bit by bit each time you day it. If you neglect to tend to your feathered friends, the [[Friendship]] meter will slowely begin to decay and the chicken's bio will change to a message along the lines of "''Chicken'' looks bored".
::::If you forget to feed your chickens while they are in their [[Coop]] or lock them out of it, the [[Friendship]] meter will begin to decay further, and the bio will change to "''Chicken'' looks thin". Remember to take care of your feathered friends, if you dont, not only will the egg quality drop, but the selling worth of you chickens will also decrease.

==Cow==
:::: When taking care of your Cows,both a healthy bond and cow is ''very'' important, not only that, but their value will increase, too!. If you neglect to keep your cows healthy, the [[Friendship]] meter will begin to decay. You can avoid this by simply Feeding, milking your cows, and closing the [[Barn]] door at night. If you forget to feed your cows, they will not die, but become very unhappy and cease production of milk.
::::The cow's bio will also change to a message along the lines of "''Cow'' looks thin". If you neglect to milk \ pet them each day, the bio will change to a message such as "''cow'' looks sad". Please remember to take care of your cows, its crucial for a well running and profitable farm.

==Pig==
:::: Pigs work a little bit differently than other animals. The [[Friendship]] aspect is the same, don't pet them, they get upset and the [[Friendship]] guage slowly decays. ''However'', unlike other animals, Pigs do not produce an item in the [[Barn]], rather they dig up truffles from the dirt around your farm.
::::Feeding your pigs, and petting them regularily is crucial to getting a profitable amount of truffles. Having a good bond is especially important when it comes to market value, If your pigs have a low value on the [[Friendship]] bar, their value will decrease.

==Duck==
::::Ducks are very similar to [[Chicken]]s. Cultivating a healthy bond with your ducks is crucial to having a supply of quality eggs and feathers. A Good way to do so is by regularily petting your Ducks, This raises your [[Friendship]] up bit by bit each time you do it. If you neglect to tend to your quacking companions, the [[Friendship]] meter will slowely begin to decay and the duck's bio will change to a message along the lines of "''Duck'' looks bored".
::::If you forget to feed your ducks while they are in their [[Coop]] or lock them out of it, the [[Friendship]] meter will begin to decay further, and the bio will change to "''Duck'' looks thin". Remember to take care of your feathered friends, if you dont, not only will the egg quality and feather count drop, but the selling worth of you ducks will also decrease.

==Bunny==
::::Rabbits are decently similar to [[Sheep]]. A happy and well fed Rabbit will produce wool every four days, and once your [[Friendship]] is strong enough, it will produce a rabbit's foot as well!
::::A great way to keep a strong bond with your floppy eared pal' is by keeping your rabbit well fed, and well loved. If you neglect to feed your rabbit, it's bio will change to a message such as "''Rabbit'' looks thin". If you forget to pet your rabbit, you will see it's bio change to a message such as "''Rabbit'' looks bored". Make sure you take good care of your Mini-Buggs-Bunny, if you don't, the rabbit's Market value will decrease heavily. After all, a happy and healthy rabbit is a profitable one.

==Goat==
::::Goats are very similar to [[Cow]]s, however they produce Goat's milk rather than normal milk. When taking care of your Goats,both a healthy bond and goat is ''very'' important, not only that, but their value will increase, too!. If you neglect to keep your goat healthy, the [[Friendship]] meter will begin to decay. You can avoid this by simply Feeding, milking your goats, and closing the [[Barn]] door at night. If you forget to feed your goats, they will not die, but become very unhappy and cease production of milk.
::::The goat's bio will also change to a message along the lines of"''Goat'' looks thin". If you neglect to milk \ pet them each day, the bio will change to a message such as "''Goat'' looks sad". Please remember to take care of your goats, its crucial for a well running and profitable farm.

==Sheep==
::::Sheep are an important animal to have on any farm, and a strong [[Friendship]] is extremely important as well. To cultivate a healthy [[Friendship]] with your sheep you need simply to feed and pet your sheep each day. A well fed and well loved sheep will grow a healthy coat of wool every 3 days. Keeping your sheep well fed is important not only for a good wool coat, but for good selling price as well.
::::A healthy, well bonded sheep has much more selling value then an unhappy, starved sheep. If you neglect to feed your sheep, the sheep's bio will change to a message along the lines of "''Sheep'' looks thin", and if you forget to pet your sheep, you will see a message like "''Sheep'' looks bored". So make sure to keep your sheep happy, full, and with a well trimmed coat.

==Ostritch==
::::Ostritches are similar to chickens, but far more valuable. A healthy, strong [[Friendship]] is very important to having a good, consistant supply of eggs. A good way to keep your Ostritch happy and healthy is by feeding them, and petting them regualarly. If you neglect to pet or feed your giraffe bird, it's bio will change to a descrption along the lines of "''Ostritch'' looks bored" or if hungry, "''Ostritch'' looks thin", And if you choose to sell your Ostritches, the stronger of a bond you have, the more market value the bird will have! So make sure to take good care of your ostritches, they are very valuable!

==Dinosaur==
::::Dinosaurs are a very unique animal. A strong [[Friendship]] is vital when caring for them. You can cultivate such a bond by feeding, petting, and nurturing them.
::::A well fed and loved dino will produce a valuable egg every 7 days. If a strong [[Friendship]] is built, and you choose to sell the Dinosaur, it's market value will increase with the quality of the bond. If you neglect to feed, pet, or let the dino into, our out of the [[Coop]], the [[Friendship]] Gauge will slowly decay, and eggs will be lower in quality and produced much less often. So take care of your prehistoric pal', it is not only important, but incredibly profitable to do so as well!
