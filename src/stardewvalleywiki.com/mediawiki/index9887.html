{{Quote|Elliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach. He is a writer who dreams of one day writing a magnificent novel. He is a sentimental “romantic” with a tendency to go off onto flowery, poetic tangents. When he can afford it, he enjoys a strong beverage at [[the Stardrop Saloon]]. Could a humble farmer such as yourself be the inspiration Elliott is looking for? There’s only one way to find out…|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

'''Elliott''' is a [[Villagers|villager]] who lives on the beach south of [[Pelican Town]]. He's one of the twelve characters available to [[marriage|marry]].

During [[Spring]], [[Summer]], and [[Fall]], players must first acquire two hearts of [[friendship]] with Elliott before being allowed inside his cabin. Players at any friendship level may enter in [[Winter]] between 10am and 6pm. 

==Schedule==
After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Elliott may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Elliott will immediately go home to bed. Elliott never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or his checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

Below are Elliott's schedules prioritized highest to lowest within each season.  For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others below it.

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 2
 |trigger = Enter Elliott's cabin when he's there.
 |details = Elliott will greet you, and explain that he came to Pelican Town to become a writer but no one from his hometown believed he could make it. He asks what kind of novels you like:

* {{choice|"Mystery"|30}}
* {{choice|"Romance"|30}}
* {{choice|"Sci-Fi"|30}}

He says he'll remember your choice, then asks you to look at his rose because he thinks it may be wilting.
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts = 4
 |trigger = Enter [[the Stardrop Saloon]] between 3pm and 10pm when [[Gus]] is there.
 |details = Gus says he'll take your order in a moment. Before he gets to you, Elliott walks into the building and says it's a pleasant surprise to find you here. He says that he's stopping in to relax after eight hours of writing. He orders two ales, one for you and one for him. He orders wine for you if your character is female.

You stop him before he can drink and propose a toast. You can choose from four different toasts:

* {{choice|"To Pelican Town!"|25}} "Ah, to a harmonious future for the community... what a virtuous idea. Here's to Pelican Town!" 
* {{choice|"To our friendship!"|50}} "That's a great idea! Here's to us!" 
* {{choice|"To my good health!"|-10}} "Well... okay." 
* {{choice|"To your doom!"|-50}} "Hmph. Forget it." 

You both drink and he starts dancing where he is. Then the cutscene ends, and you are transported outside the door of [[the Stardrop Saloon]].

Note: The beverage consumed during the heart event will heal up to 50 [[Energy]] and 22 [[Health]], and leave the player with the "[[Buffs|Tipsy]]" buff. 
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Enter Elliott's home when he's there.
 |details = Elliott is playing the piano. After he finishes, the player has a dialogue option:
*{{choice|"That was wonderful"|0}}
*{{choice|"How long have you been playing?"|0}}
Elliott talks about how difficult it's been to finish his novel and says "Sometimes I wish I could just throw it all away and become a farmer like you."  The player can respond with:
*{{choice|"It's just as hard to be a farmer, you know"|0}}
Elliott apologizes for being insensitive and clarifies that what he really wants is to experience "real life".
*{{choice|"Come live on the farm, I could use the extra help"|0}}
Elliott is surprised but declines the offer, saying he needs to finish his novel.
}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = After receiving a letter from Elliott, visit the [[museum]] between 1pm and 7pm. (It doesn't need to be the same day.)
 |details = Elliott sends you a letter inviting you to a reading of his finished novel at the library that afternoon.

When you enter the museum, you find many villagers have gathered to listen to Elliott's first book reading. Elliott expresses his delight at your coming to listen. He reads from his novel. Depending on your choice in his first heart event, you'll get one of these stories:
* The mystery novel ''Blue Tower''. "It's a mystery novel set in a surreal, dystopian future. Chapter One. From the shadows emerged a man, radiating with enigmatic omniscience. 'Good Evening, Mr. Lu,' he said, the corners of his mouth quivering. Lu seemed astonished. 'How did you know my name?'" ''(Fade.)'' "Lu checked Jenu's pockets, then stood up and walked into the bedroom. He quickly found the small golden key that he was looking for and slipped it into his coat pocket."
* The romance novel ''Camellia Station''. "It's a romance novel about a train stewardess who falls in love with a traveling architect... Chapter One. 'Your ticket, sir?' Ticket collector Gozman extended a gloved hand towards the young commuter. 'Ah, yes. I have it right here,' he replied, reaching into his coat pocket. Mortified, he discovered that the ticket was missing." ''(Fade.)'' "...'Clara, there's something I must tell you,' he blurted as she turned to leave. Clara turned, slowly, and saw the look of desperation in Horatio's eye. At that moment Gozman burst into the compartment, red-faced."
* The sci-fi novel ''The Rise And Fall Of Planet Yazzo''. "It's a sci-fi epic spanning thousands of years in an exotic planetary system. Chapter One. Commander Yutkin stepped through the golden archway as the airlock snapped shut behind him. Today was his first day on Planet Yazzo, and all 14 of the alliance delegates had been summoned to the Grand Spire..." ''(Fade.)'' "...And as the 7th moon descended beneath the horizon, the planet of Yazzo would begin its sinister transformation... an event for which Commander Yutkin was completely unprepared."

Elliott thanks everyone for coming, then walks up to you and asks how you think it went. He says he's glad that you liked it, because he dedicated it to you and he based it on your favorite genre.

[[File:Elliot Eight Heart Event.jpg|500px]]
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = Go to the beach on a day when it is not raining between 7am and 1pm. A letter will be sent to you but it is not needed to trigger the event.
 |details = Elliott writes you a letter saying he has an idea. You join him on the docks. Elliott had fixed the row boat that's been on the docks, and he wonders if you want to go with him on a "maiden voyage."

* If you accept, Elliott talks about his novel and how he couldn't have done it without you. Then he's at a loss for words to explain how he feels about you. Suddenly, he kisses you! You begin trembling. 
**{{Choice|I'm happy|50}}
:If your character is a man, he will comment on how he didn't know if you would have feelings for another man. You both head back to shore, and Elliott comments on how the valley finally looks like home.
:*{{Choice|You're making me very uncomfortable. Stop.|-50}}
:Elliott apologizes and the scene ends.
* If you refuse, Elliott says "I see" and the event ends.

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|boys}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger= Exit the farm house between 6am and 3pm on a day when there are no [[Festivals]] occurring for the next 8 days.
 |details = Elliott will be on the front porch when the player leaves the farmhouse. 

Elliott will send the player [[letters#Friendship letters|letters]] in the mail daily for a full week while he is touring for his book signing. 

On the second day of the week of his absence, one [[Crab Cakes]] will appear in the player's fridge or [[Mini-Fridge]] if there is available space.

On the 8th day, he will arrive back at the farmhouse, and the last part of the event will trigger as soon as the player wakes up.
}}

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Elliott will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small garden behind the farmhouse where he'll sometimes go to read.

On rainy mornings and mornings when Elliott stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you [[Coffee]].  On rainy nights, he may offer you dinner:  [[Baked Fish]], [[Fried Calamari]], [[Chowder]], or [[Fish Stew]].  On New Years' Eve (Winter 28), he'll give you a bottle of [[Wine]].
