<p>Crows will not eat seeds, but are seeds included when determining whether or not a crow will spawn? For example, if I have 15 plants and 15 seeds, am I safe from crows? It is not clear to me from the current description and I have not decompiled the code.

<dl><dd>I have no proof of the game code but I know from my own experience that when you plant a long-growing crop (for example: Sweet Gem Berry) and do not put scarecrows, the crop disappears because of the crows. I hope my information is of some use and it would be nice if someone else corroborated my experience or denied it if that is the case. 😋</dd>

<dd>PS: Obviously, if the information is correct, it applies to any crop, except that I gave the example of the Sweet Gem Berry because it is a seed that takes a long time to change its growth stage. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Viruz_PoP" title="User:Viruz PoP">┌(・。・)┘♪ Viruz PoP</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Viruz_PoP" title="User talk:Viruz PoP">talk</a>) 00:56, 21 March 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Viruz PoP is correct. The day after planting, a "crop" is no longer a seed, despite appearances. As the page says "Crows will not eat crops grown from wild seeds, seeds themselves (<i>i.e.,</i> crops planted that day)...." 05:10, 21 March 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Okay, now I'm really confused. In my experience, crows show up first thing in the morning. So the only way "planted that day" makes sense is if it applies to the day just past. If I plant Parsnips on Spring 6, aren't I safe from waking up to see them eaten on Spring 7? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 06:50, 21 March 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That's correct, if you plant parsnips on day 6 you will be safe from the crows, the problem comes from the next day (7) where if you have +15 seeds growing without any scarecrows then there is a chance that at least one crop will disappear. This information is also described (albeit in less detail) on the page: <i><a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crops#Crows" title="Crops">"Crops #1.2 - Crows"</a>.</i></dd>

<dl><dd>As far as I know, any seed at the time of planting, the next day ceases to be a seed and is classified as a growth stage 1 crop, even if it is not irrigated. And also the crows can eat those crops. But I can be wrong 😅 <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:Emojis192.png" class="image"><img alt="Emojis192.png" src="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d6/Emojis192.png/24px-Emojis192.png" decoding="async" width="24" height="24" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d6/Emojis192.png/36px-Emojis192.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/d/d6/Emojis192.png/48px-Emojis192.png 2x" /></a></dd>

<dd>if I'm wrong then, only the following can apply: "The day after planting, a "crop" is no longer a seed, despite appearances. As the page says "Crows will not eat crops grown from wild seeds, seeds themselves (i.e. crops planted that day)..." 05:10, 21 Mar 2022 (UTC)"</dd>

<dl><dd>I tried to research this using the game code, but am having problems with it running, so I tried to research in-game, and went almost an entire season with 335 unwatered parsnip seeds and no crows. My one anecdotal test would seem to indicate that a seed is a seed until it's watered, but further testing is definitely required. I will keep digging, and this is a fascinating question. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 01:32, 22 March 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I would like to revisit my original question, and ask it a different way to hopefully be more clear. Suppose I start a new farm. On Spring 1, I plant Lewis's 15 Parsnip seeds and nothing else. They are obviously safe on the night of Spring 1. They are also safe on the night of Spring 2, because there are still fewer than 16 crops planted. Now suppose I plant a single Potato seed on Spring 3. What happens on the night of Spring 3? We all agree that the Potato seed won't be eaten because it was just planted, but are the Parsnips still safe? Does it totally ignore the Potato and not spawn a crow, or does it spawn a crow and just not let the crow eat the potato if it happens to select that space to attack? I think both are reasonable interpretations of, "Crows will not eat (seeds just planted)". [For purposes of this question, assume everything is watered every day. The watering question is an interesting one, but not the one I'm asking.] <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 18:09, 22 March 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Your potato and all the parsnips are at risk of being eaten by crows on the night of Spring 3/morning of Spring 4 (for the purposes of this question, night and morning are the same thing). The parsnip seeds (and the potato) are safe on Spring 3, because crows only happen overnight. Does that help? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Margotbean" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:30, 22 March 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>My animals refuse to give birth, though for my knowledge all prerequisites are met I've been trying for more than an in-game-year now.

<p>Anyone in favor of creating a new page for each different kind of animal (pet, horse, farm animal, environment animals, etc.)? This page is already quite lengthy, especially considering 1.6 additions to pets. Different kinds of animals are unrelated in terms of game mechanics anyway. <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Ifp" title="User:Ifp">Ifp</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Ifp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Ifp (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 19:00, 21 March 2024 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I agree that those types of animals all serve different functions within the game, so that they're different topics.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Okay. I'll wait a bit longer to see if anyone else has anything to say.

Turtles give Sea Jelly and Cave Jelly, while cats give River Jelly (their pool of items includes basically anything that can be fished from Cindersap river or the Mountain lake, if I recall correctly). <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Bluestblur" title="User:Bluestblur">Bluestblur</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Bluestblur" title="User talk:Bluestblur">talk</a>) 02:27, 16 May 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="No_heaters_in_Winter">No heaters in Winter</span></h2>
<p>I know from personal experience that animal produce is negatively affected by not having a heater in an animal building in Winter. I assume this is a function of Mood. But I'm not seeing anything that shows any negative effect of lacking heaters in Winter. Is there something that I'm not seeing, or is there just not anything there? <a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Zendowolf" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../../external.html?link=https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User_talk:Zendowolf" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 03:10, 16 June 2024 (UTC)
