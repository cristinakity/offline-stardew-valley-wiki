{{Quote|...Have you encountered others like me, in the mines? I'm sorry if they were hostile towards you. You see, we've learned to fear humans... there have been too many... unpleasant encounters.|Krobus}}

==Schedule==
Krobus can always be found in the Sewers once [[the Player]] obtains the [[Rusty Key]].

==Shop==
{{Spoiler}}
Krobus' Shop is open all hours every day, even [[Festivals|festival]] days.

==Relationships==
Krobus is almost never seen outside interacting with other [[villagers]]. He dislikes [[Dwarf|dwarves]], stating that a 1,000 year [[Setting#The Elemental Wars|war]] between the dwarves and his people recently ended. He believes if the dwarves knew where he was, they'd send an assassin.

The [[Wizard]] is aware of his presence and [[Dwarf#Heart Events|intervenes]] to prevent conflicts.

==Gifts==
{{GiftHeader}}

For loved, liked, or neutral gifts, Krobus will say
{{Quote|Oh, a gift to remember the day that I hatched! Thank you!}}

For disliked or hated gifts, Krobus will say
{{Quote|Oh... is this what you call a 'birthday present'? I don't understand humans...}}

===Love===
{{Quote|This is an amazing gift. For my people it is a great honor to receive something like this.}} 
''Void Mayonnaise''
{{Quote|This smells delicious! I'll eat half, and use the other half to moisturize my body...}}
''Monster Compendium''
{{Quote|Hey, look! All my friends are in here.&lt;br>Wait a minute, is that me...?}}
''Monster Musk''
{{Quote|A gift of lovely perfume? Oh, (Name)... I'm blushing, but you probably can't notice...}}
''Stardrop Tea''
{{Quote|Is that Stardrop Tea? Thank you! One drop makes my room smell good for the whole day.}}

==Roommate==
If the player is not [[Marriage|married]], Krobus will move into the [[farmhouse]] three days after accepting a [[Void Ghost Pendant|void ghost pendant]]. Like the marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He will not set up an area in the space behind the farmhouse.

Krobus leaves the Farmhouse only on rainy days, when he will stand on the front porch. At 13 hearts, he will give the player a [[Stardrop]], like a spouse, and may change [[Wallpaper]] or [[Flooring]] or add [[Furniture]] like a spouse.

Although the player's relationship with Krobus is platonic, the game's roommate mechanics are almost identical to the marriage mechanics, with the following exceptions:
*Kissing is replaced with hugging.
*Instead of a heart emoji appearing when kissing, a smile emoji appears when hugging.
*No ceremony takes place.
*Krobus will never get [[Marriage#Jealousy|jealous]] if the player gives a gift to a marriage candidate.
*Being roommates with Krobus won't stop the [[Bouquet#Group 10-Heart Event|group 10-heart events]].
*Instead of [[Marriage#Divorce|divorce]], Krobus can be evicted for free. However, the player still needs to do this through the book in the [[Mayor's Manor]]. After Krobus moves out, he is silent towards the player and will refuse gifts.
**As with an ex-spouse, the [[Dark Shrine of Memory]] can be used to erase Krobus' memories of the player.
*You cannot have or adopt children with Krobus. However, he helps with raising your existing children from previous marriages.
*Krobus does not do chores like a spouse would.
*Krobus does not sleep, but he will stand in the center of his room at 10:00 P.M., He can still be interacted with, however, unlike spouses.

After Krobus moves into the [[Farmhouse]], he is replaced in [[the Sewers]] by a chest, which sells his usual items.

On rainy mornings, Krobus may gift you a [[Sea Urchin]], [[Void Egg]], [[Void Mayonnaise]], or [[Void Salmon]]. On non-rainy days, he may gift you a [[Fried Eel]], [[Lucky Lunch]], or [[Poppyseed Muffin]]. He may also gift you a [[Strange Bun]] regardless of the current weather.

 |details = Krobus sits on the docks at the Beach watching Moonlight Jellies swim, when [[The Merpeople|a sea monster]] appears. The sea monster raises its tentacles, and Krobus hops on for a ride. A heart dialogue bubble appears over Krobus' head, indicating he enjoyed the ride.

==Quests==
*[[Quests#Dark Talisman|Dark Talisman]]: After the [[Wizard]] requests his [[Magic Ink]], the player must talk to Krobus, who will open the force field blocking the passage to the [[Mutant Bug Lair]], where the talisman can be found.
*[[Quests#A Winter Mystery|"A Winter Mystery"]]: Sent by mail the day after triggering a cutscene by entering the [[Bus Stop]] from [[the Farm]] during [[Winter]] between 6am and 4pm. To complete the quest, interact with a bush to the left of the [[Community Center]] in the north of [[Pelican Town]]. A cutscene ensues, during which a "Shadow Guy" (who may or may not be Krobus) gives the player a [[Magnifying Glass]]. This allows the player to collect [[Secret Notes]].

==Trivia==
*Krobus states that his name means "bridge-crosser" in his language.
*Krobus states that he remains silent on Fridays out of respect for Yoba. His normal Friday dialogue is simply "..." Krobus will speak on Fridays under certain circumstances.
**Rainy days
**First meeting
**Attempting to give him a gift after he has been evicted as a roommate
**Speaking to him about the [[Dark Talisman]] quest
**Gifting him a [[Void Ghost Pendant]]
*Attempting to give Krobus a [[Movie Ticket]] on Friday results in a dialogue saying "Krobus looks puzzled..." Krobus will not attend movies on Fridays.
*Krobus' Tuesday dialogue changed from "I am too sensitive to sunlight to go out during the day." to "I am too sensitive to sunlight to go out on most days." with v1.3. This change is most likely due to the addition of the [[Quests#A Winter Mystery|"A Winter Mystery" Quest]], in which a "Shadow Guy" is seen outdoors during Winter.
*Krobus' people are said to have crossed into the physical plane after "a great catastrophe."
*Despite being considered a roommate, if there are monsters inside the house, such as [[slimes]], he will still say, ''"Um... Honey? Why are there monsters in the house?"''
*Krobus is the only NPC who dislikes Stardrop Sorbet as a [[Movie Theater]] snack. However, he still loves [[Stardrop Tea]].
**His dialogue when gifted Stardrop Tea implies he likes its scent rather than taste: "Is that Stardrop Tea? Thank you! One drop makes my room smell good for the whole day."
*Krobus says that he normally does not sleep. However, he will fall asleep while watching any movie except [[Movie Theater#Movies|Mysterium]].
*While watching Mysterium, Krobus has negative dialogue about the depiction of shadow people within the movie. However, he still likes the movie overall and gains friendship from watching it.

==Bugs==
*If multiple players open Krobus' shop in [[Multiplayer]] simultaneously, the limited quantity of items can be bypassed (multiplied by number of players). As an example, this allows two players on Friday to purchase two [[Iridium Sprinkler]]s instead of one, if neither player has already purchased the Sprinkler.
