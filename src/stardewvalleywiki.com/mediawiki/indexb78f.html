"If the player chooses the <a href="../Farm_Maps.html" title="Farm Maps">Riverland Farm</a> or the Forest Farm, Walleye can also be caught in the farm pond."
</p><p>Game code indicates it's available in Riverlands, Hill-Top, Forest, Wilderness, and Four Corners Farms, and I see <i>nothing</i> indicating the Walleye is restricted to the Forest Farm Pond and not the River as well. Also the <a href="../Bundles.html#Fish_Tank" title="Bundles">Bundles</a> page doesn't include the Mountain Lake as a catchable location. I'm not going to make changes without verifying with someone here as I've gotten some slight pushback on cleaning things up and consistency. Also think it would be nice if the Bundles themselves were Heading 3 or 4 or whatever so they could be accessible through the TOC, but that's just my opinion.

<dl><dd>There is no river on the Forest Farm, so I'm not sure what you mean there. When you say "game code" you need to specify which function and class you're referring to. And <i>as I said on my talk page</i>, the game code can be tricky. You need to step through the code and/or test extensively in-game before making multiple changes to the wiki, especially when you're adjusting your own changes. Alright?</dd>
<dd>In <samp>Farm::getFish</samp>, the location is set to 0 for the Hill-Top farm (which normally means river), 1 for Riverland, Forest, &amp; 4-Corners farms (which normally means pond), and -1 (anywhere) for all other farms. <b>However</b>, we need to test in-game and step through the code to be sure that those are accurate. This is a time-consuming process! So, when I say "proceed with caution", I mean it.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, there are inconsistencies across pages on the wiki, and I appreciate your desire and efforts to rectify those. The Bundles page says the Walleye can be found in "Lakes" -- this should say "the Mountain Lake", as it's the only lake in the game (the "lake" in Cindersap Forest is a pond, not a lake). That's an easy problem to fix. As for the rest, we need more testing before making changes.  <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 03:52, 9 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Typo, meant Cindersap Forest when referring to the Pond/River. I didn't specify it here but I've specified it in multiple locations. I'm cross referencing Data\Locations, Data\Fish, and Farm::getFish. Hill-Top Farm setting 0 is referring to Data\Locations which specifies a 0 for River in Cindersap Forest, which Hill-Top pulls its pool from (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../Modding_Fish_data.html#Spawn_locations)and">https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Fish_data#Spawn_locations)and</a> etc etc I'm saying the same thign you've said the same, but I guess I shoot back to "if we can't trust the code, what can we trust". In the meantime, I posit a question: Should we leave misleading or incorrect information if the code says otherwise when compared to the wiki, without testing? Or should we make an edit with code-"correct" information with/without a reference or note? I just want to make sure I'm marking the correct locations to come back to, or if I need to "ignore" it until there's proof. <a href="../User_Spiderkace.html" title="User:Spiderkace">Spiderkace</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Spiderkace.html" title="User talk:Spiderkace">talk</a>) 04:08, 9 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>We both want the same thing: an accurate wiki. My only issue is that you've made multiple changes, and then went back and edited them to remove the 4-Corners farm, in the same day. So, slow down!</dd>
<dd>And, no, you can't always trust the code unless you step through it. However, in this case, I think creating a farm and doing some fishing would enough to verify the changes you want to make that are based on the static code from ILSpy. So, mark the spots where you see things that look wrong, make sure you're reasonably correct about your changes (by doing some fishing on a non-standard farm map), and then make the changes. If you wait for proof from someone else, you'll be waiting a long time, as my "to do" list stretches back to v1.3 in some cases. ok? Good?

<dl><dd>I can agree there. Clearly I'm new to wiki editing and got a little... ambitious. You want info vetted, and I understand it. Do you have that list publicly where I could possibly look into/test some things for you? If I can assist there or at least take more time off of you double checking other's work, I'm sure the wiki would benefit. <a href="../User_Spiderkace.html" title="User:Spiderkace">Spiderkace</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Spiderkace.html" title="User talk:Spiderkace">talk</a>) 15:41, 9 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'm very glad we're on the same page! Perhaps you could add info about non-standard farms to pages for fish that aren't used in Bundles? We agree at this point that your existing edits are good info, so there's no reason not to. Thank you very much! I'm glad I didn't squash your enthusiasm entirely... 😁</dd>
<dd>I'll move over to your talk page with the details about another project. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:23, 9 November 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
