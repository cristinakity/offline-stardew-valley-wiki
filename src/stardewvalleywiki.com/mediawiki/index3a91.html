{{Quote|I've been Mayor of [[Pelican Town]] for over twenty years! No one ever runs against me when it's time for an election. I like to think that it means I'm doing my job well. I like being Mayor.|Lewis}}

'''Lewis''' is the mayor of [[Pelican Town]]. Along with [[Robin]], he greets [[The Player|the player]] when they move to the Valley and explains a little bit about life on the farm. Lewis is known to have some sort of relations with [[Marnie]], as the shorts he lost and brown suspenders are found in her bedroom. Furthermore, a note can be found in his bedroom in the lower left on a shelf under a coffee mug, believed to be from her. The note is signed "-M".

When a [[Festivals|festival]] takes place, the player will receive a [[Letters|letter]] in their mailbox, usually from Lewis, that says where and when it takes place, as well as any additional requirements.

==Schedule==
{{Spoiler}}
After the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort|Beach Resort]] on Ginger Island is unlocked, Lewis may randomly spend the day there. After leaving the Island at 6pm, Lewis will immediately go home to bed. Lewis never visits the Resort on [[Festivals|Festival]] days or his checkup day at [[Harvey's Clinic]].

==Relationships==
As nobody has challenged Lewis for his title of mayor in the twenty years he has held the position, he may have a good relationship with everyone living in Pelican Town. He was apparently good friends with the player's [[Grandpa|grandfather]]; if the player speaks to him while he is at [[The Stardrop Saloon]], Lewis states that he will be having an extra drink in their grandfather's honor.

In parallel with his work as mayor, he is also involved in the Stardew Valley Agricultural Fund. He may send the player a letter that includes money from the fund "to help you continue your good work", such as using it to buy seeds.

He has never been married and has no family; all he lives for is being mayor. He sometimes questions if it was worth it.

Lewis is particularly good friends with [[Marnie]], as shown in [[Quests#Mayor's &amp;ldquo;Shorts&amp;rdquo;|the "Mayor's Shorts"]] story quest. He can also sometimes be found inside [[Marnie's Ranch]] saying, "I'm just here to make sure all of Marnie's business needs are met." Additionally, his and Marnie's 6-heart event confirms that they are in a relationship, although he does not want the relationship to become public knowledge.

Lewis says it would undermine his authority, while Marnie says he's too concerned for his job.  In the end, Marnie says she'll keep their relationship a secret.  Afterwards, you'll pop up and scare both Lewis and Marnie.  Lewis asks you if you heard anything, and you are presented with a choice.

==Quests==
*[[Quests#Mayor's &amp;ldquo;Shorts&amp;rdquo;|"Mayor's Shorts"]]: Lewis will send the player a letter on the 3rd of [[Summer]] explaining that he lost his shorts and offers a reward to anyone who can find and return them to him ''discreetly.'' The player earns {{Price|750}} and 1 [[Friendship]] heart for completing the quest.
**If instead the player chooses to place the shorts in their [[Stardew Valley Fair#Grange Display|Grange display]] during Fall, Mayor Lewis will instead be upset, calling it a "sick joke" and pay the player off with 750 Star Tokens, demanding they return his shorts the following day. However, the player can decide to keep them and repeat this the following year, without loss in friendship points.
**If instead the player chooses to add the shorts as a "special ingredient" to the soup present at the [[Luau]] festival, a unique dialogue involving the [[Governor]] and Lewis transpires. This does not affect friendship with the Valley's [[Villagers]].
*[[Quests#Mayor's Need|"Mayor's Need"]]: Lewis will send the player a letter on the 21st of [[Summer]] in year 2 asking them to bring him a bottle of [[Truffle Oil]]. The reward is {{Price|750}} and 1 [[Friendship]] heart.
*Lewis may request that the player slay a random number of [[Monsters]] or bring him a random item at the [[Quests#Help Wanted Quests|"Help Wanted" board]] outside [[Pierre's General Store]]. The reward for slaying monsters varies by the number and type of monster, but is always an amount of gold. The reward for completing an item delivery request is 3x the item's base value and 150 [[Friendship]] points.
*[[Quests#Crop Order|"Crop Order"]]: On the Special Orders board in front of the [[Mayor's Manor]], Lewis may randomly request that the player harvest and ship 100 season-dependent [[crops]]. The reward is [[gold]] equal to 50% of the sell price of the crop and a [[Mini-Shipping Bin]].
