The world of Stardew Valley is described through various item descriptions, dialogue options, and [[Lost Books]] donated to the [[Museum]].

== Races ==
&lt;gallery mode="nolines">
File:Lewis.png|Humans
File:Dwarf.png|Dwarves
File:Krobus.png|Shadow People
File:Junimo.gif|Junimos
File:Henchman Portrait 1.png|Goblins
File:Mermaid.png|Merpeople
&lt;/gallery>

There are also Elves, Tundra Dwellers, and fairies.

=== Humans ===
Humans make up the majority of [[Setting#Geography|Stardew Valley]]'s population. Most humans live normal lives, however [[Wizard]]s and Witches still exist and study ancient arcane energies.

=== Dwarves ===
Dwarves call themselves 'Smoluanu', or 'Sky People'. They are known for living underground and once having advanced technology in ancient times. Archaeologist M. Jasper believes they are an alien race, as indicated in the [[Lost Books|Lost Book]] entitled ''[[Lost Books#Mysteries of the Dwarves|Mysteries of the Dwarves]]''. One [[dwarf]] can be found living in [[The Mines]] while a second is running a [[Volcano Dungeon#Shop|Shop]] in the Volcano Dungeon.

=== Shadow People ===
Shadow people are beings that cannot stand the light. They fought in the Elemental Wars when the Dwarves invaded their ancestral home deep underground. [[Krobus]] is a shadow person who can be found living in [[The Sewers]]. Most of the shadow people encountered in the game are [[monsters]] found in [[the Mines]], known as [[Shadow Brute]]s and [[Shadow Shaman]]s. Humans also call them Void Spirits.

=== Junimos ===
{{main article|Junimos}}
Keepers of the forest. They are spirits that live with the trees. Most of the Junimos can be found living in the [[Community Center]]. They have inspired the [[Junimo Kart]] video game.

=== Fairies ===
Fairies are magical beings which are mentioned in old legends but can also be encountered by the player. A fairy is summoned by the [[Fairy Box]] [[Trinkets|trinket]]. A fairy may occasionally appear to [[Random Events#The Crop Fairy|bless crops]] on the [[The Farm|farm]]. As hinted in the item's description, the [[Fairy Rose]] attracts fairies and increases the chance of this happening. The description of [[Fairy Stone]] reads "{{Description|Fairy Stone}}"

=== Elves ===
Nimble and skilled craftsmen. The description for [[Elvish Jewelry]] reads "Dirty but still beautiful. On the side is a flowing script thought by some to be the ancient language of the elves. No Elvish bones have ever been found." An ‘elf quesadilla’ can be prepared by the chef at the Desert festival, granting the player +3 attack and +1 luck.

=== Goblins ===
Goblins are described in the [[Lost Books|Lost Book]] titled ''[[Lost Books#Goblins|Goblins]]''. The [[Henchman]] is a goblin who can be encountered guarding the [[Witch's Hut]] and will only move after being given [[Void Mayonnaise]], which is considered a delicacy by the Goblin race.

=== Merpeople ===
{{main article|The Merpeople}}
The [[Wizard]] makes a reference to their existence during the [[Luau]]. At the [[Night Market]] there is a Mermaid Boat, where upon entering, a mermaid will appear and begin singing to the player, accompanied by a cutscene. On rainy days a Mermaid will appear on the large rock by the shore of the [[Ginger Island|Pirate Cove]] on [[Ginger Island]]. Very rarely, a green sea monster might appear under the left-most pier at The Beach and then swim south.  This may or may not be a merperson.  It is purely cosmetic and cannot be caught by fishing. Two merpeople appear in the [[perfection]] cutscene.

===Tundra Dwellers===
Referenced by [[Linus]] at the [[Festival of Ice]], when he says "Igloo-building's an art I picked up from the tundra dwellers who live beyond the frozen sea." This may simply be referring to a specific group of humans.

== Timeline ==
=== The Elemental Wars ===
An event referenced by the [[Wizard]]. It was the war between the Dwarves and Shadow People. The Dwarves, having driven the Shadow People from their ancestral home, forced the Shadow People to resort to violence. The Elemental Wars have long been finished, and the Dwarves and Shadow People must now live in peace for the sake of the humans living around them. 

== Geography ==
&lt;div class="thumbinner" style="float: right; font-style: italic; font-size: smaller; padding: 8px; margin-left: 12px;">[[File:Globe.png|72px|class=pixels]]&lt;br />Stardew Valley Globe&lt;br />&lt;br />[[File:World Map.png|140px|class=pixels]]&lt;br />Stardew Valley World Map&lt;/div>
=== Stardew Valley ===
A peaceful region located on the southern coast of the [[Setting#Nations|Ferngill Republic]]. [[Harvey]] identifies its location over his shortwave radio as [[Pelican Town#Trivia|52 north, 43.5 east]].

=== Gem Sea ===
The ocean that makes up the entire southern coast of [[Pelican Town]]. Rumors suggest that [[Gunther]] comes from across the Gem Sea.

=== Fern Islands ===
An archipelago in the Gem Sea belonging to the Ferngill Republic. [[Willy]] is from there. When married to [[Haley]], if at 13 hearts she will ask the player if they ever thought about retirement. [[Haley]] wishes to spend your days together there. [[Gus]] usually uses Fern Island Ringfruit for his premier candy canes, according to his dialogue during the [[Feast of the Winter Star]].

[[Ginger Island|Ginger Island]] can be accessed after repairing the boat in the backroom of Willy’s Fish Shop and buying tickets.  Ginger Island is the only island available to visit in the archipelago, though other islands can be seen from the boat on the way there. Ginger island appears to be the largest island.

=== Castle Village ===
Castle Village is known for its "artisanal velvet" as mentioned in the description of [[Earmuffs]]. Its exact location is not mentioned.

=== Zuzu City ===
[[File:Zuzu City.png|thumb|right|140px|Panoramic night view&lt;br />of Zuzu City]]
This is the City where a number of people from Pelican Town are from. [[Haley]] apparently has visited it, as [[The Queen of Sauce]] mentions that she reportedly fell in love with her [[Pink Cake]] after visiting Zuzu City. [[Alex]] notes that they have a gridball team called the Zuzu City Tunnelers, [[Sam]] mentions he used to live there, and [[Shane]] will take [[the Player]] to a match for his [[Shane#Ten Hearts|10-heart event]]. Leah's ex, Kel, says in Leah's 10-heart event that they came all the way from Zuzu City to see the sculptures (Note: This only happens if you suggested the art show at the 2-heart event for Leah).  After collecting all [[Scarecrow#Rarecrows|rarecrows]], a letter is sent signed by "The Z.C. Rarecrow Society".

The [[Movie Theater#Movies|movie]] "The Zuzu City Express" also references Zuzu City.

===Grampleton===
One of the dialogue choices during [[Penny]]'s 8-heart event may lead the player to refer to Stardew Valley's natural resources by saying "You'll find no better lumber south of Grampleton."

During [[Clint]]'s 6-heart event he invites [[Emily]] to the Grampleton Carnival.

The [[Movie Theater|movie]] "It Howls in the Rain" references Grampleton.

One of the fishers at the [[Trout Derby]] says "I came all the way from Grampleton for this."

===Prairie Island===
Referenced in the [[Movie Theater#Movies|movie]] "Natural Wonders: Exploring Our Vibrant World", it is an island far to the west of the Gem Sea, home to a diverse array of natural biomes and an abundant population of raccoons. The name "Prairie Island" possibly in reference to [[Journey of the Prairie King]].

== Nations ==
=== Ferngill Republic ===
The nation in which Stardew Valley is located. [[Kent]] is a soldier for the Ferngill Republic, and is a survivor from a Gotoro prison camp. [[Morris]] believes that the Joja Corporation is good for the country as a whole.

A plaque on the waiting room wall of [[Harvey's Clinic]] reads "This clinic is licensed for medical practice by the Ferngill Republic Health Authority."

In [[Livin' Off The Land]], on the 25th of Fall, Year 2, the host mentions that "it's just a couple of days until communities around the Ferngill Republic celebrate [[Spirit's Eve]]!" This suggests that the holiday is celebrated only in the Republic, but this is not elaborated further.

=== Gotoro Empire ===
{{main article|Gotoro Empire}}
A nation at war with the Ferngill Republic. Located across the [[Setting#Geography|Gem Sea]], south of Stardew Valley. The [[Traveling Cart]] contains goods smuggled out of the [[Gotoro Empire]].

== Religion ==
[[File:Yoba's symbol.png|thumb|right|80px|Yoba's symbol]]
=== Yoba ===
{{main article|Yoba}}
Yoba is the creator deity. A shrine to Yoba is located in [[Pierre's General Store]], and a [[Sign Of The Vessel]] can be found in [[Pam]]’s house once [[Carpenter's Shop#Trailer|upgraded]]. Yoba is worshiped by both humans and shadow people, and a "sign of the vessel" appears on the plaque above the forge on Ginger island, suggesting the dwarves may also believe in Yoba. The symbol of Yoba can be found in [[Yoba#References to Yoba|various places]] throughout Stardew Valley.

== Organizations &amp; Factions ==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" widths=128px heights=128px>
File:Morris.png|Joja Corporation
File:Marlon.png|Adventurer's Guild
&lt;/gallery>

=== Joja Corporation ===
A megacorp that seems to cover shipping, warehousing, distribution, mining activities, emergency medical services, and energy drink production. [[The Player]] used to work for them. [[Morris]] is the manager of the local [[JojaMart]], and [[Sam]], [[Shane]] and an unnamed cashier work at the local [[JojaMart]] unless the player completes the [[Community Center]].

=== Adventurer's Guild ===
{{main article|Adventurer's Guild}}
A place where adventurers gather to swap stories and sell their loot, the Adventurer's Guild is for those who have proven themselves courageous and strong. [[The Player]] is initially not a part of the guild, but upon entering [[the Mines]] for the first time, they are sent a letter the following day from [[Marlon]], the leader of the Adventurer's Guild, who invites you into the guild if you slay 10 [[slimes]]. Upon entering, you are able to purchase [[Weapons|swords]], [[rings]], and [[Footwear|boots]], as well as receive rewards from [[Gil]], an old adventurer, for completing [[Adventurer's Guild#Monster Eradication Goals|monster-slaying goals]].

=== Z.C. Rarecrow Society ===
A society that will send you the recipe for the [[Deluxe Scarecrow]] after you gather all eight of the [[Scarecrow#Rarecrows|Rarecrows]].
