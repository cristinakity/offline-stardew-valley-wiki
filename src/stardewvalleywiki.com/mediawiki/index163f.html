'''Random Farm Events''' happen overnight when the player sleeps.

==Farm events==
One farm event is randomly selected each night. An event is always selected (except if there's a [[Marriage|wedding]]), but it might have extra requirements that make it do nothing; in that case, it still prevents other events from triggering. The event is chosen in the order listed below.

===Nothing===
No event happens on the night before a wedding, or if another event is selected below but does nothing.

===Earthquake===
An earthquake on the 3rd day of [[Summer]] Year 1 unlocks the [[railroad]] area.

===Bundle completion===
An event is shown for completing a [[Community Center]] or [[Joja Community Development Form|Joja]] bundle.

===Strong wind storm===
A strong wind storm blows the Big Tree in Cindersap Forest down and replaces it with the [[Giant Stump]]. The quest has a 10% chance to trigger each night after the [[Greenhouse]] construction. The stump may then be interacted with to begin the [[Quests#The Giant Stump|"The Giant Stump"]] quest.

===The Crop Fairy===
Except in winter or on the last day of a season, there's a 1% chance of the fairy event being chosen. If there is a fully grown [[Fairy Rose]] this is increased to 1.7%. If it's not raining, the event chooses a random crop that's not from [[Crafting#Seeds|Wild Seeds]] and not fully-grown or dead. The crop fairy fully grows all crops in a 5x5 area around the selected crop, so they're ready to harvest. Although the center crop can't be from [[Crafting#Seeds|Wild Seeds]], one of the surrounding crops can be; in that case, they'll all produce the same item chosen at random.

If it's raining or no crop was found, the event does nothing.

===The Witch===
There's a 1% chance of the witch event being chosen. The event randomly chooses one [[coop]] (each with an 80% chance if it's been upgraded at least once, and has fewer than 50 placed objects), or one [[Slime Hutch]] (each with a 50% chance if it contains at least one [[Slimes|slime]] or other NPC, and has no [[Wicked Statue]]). If one of the following buildings were not selected, the event does nothing.

The witch flies over the selected building.
*If a coop was selected, she leaves a [[Void Egg]] that can be incubated into a [[Void Chicken]].
**If 100% [[Perfection]] has been reached, there is a 60% chance that a gold witch will instead appear and leave a [[Golden Egg]] that can be incubated into a [[Golden Chicken]].
*If a slime hutch was selected, she turns any slimes inside into [[Slimes#Variations|black slimes]].

In late-game, the [[Witch's Hut]] can be visited, but the witch is never present.

|}

===Meteorite===
[[File:Meteorite 2.png|thumb|right|A meteorite on the Farm.]]
There's a 1% chance of the meteorite event being chosen. The event chooses a random 3x3 area on [[the Farm]] and checks whether it contains any water, placed objects that block movement, buildings, or resource clumps. If it does, the event does nothing. Otherwise, the meteorite will spawn in the lower left 2x2 square within this area.

A unique &lt;samp>Meteorite&lt;/samp> sound effect plays and a meteorite appears the next day on the farm in the selected area. Any crops or paths in that area are destroyed. This can be counter-productive, especially if the crops being grown are of more value than the loot from the meteorite. Before the [[Secrets#Shipping_Screen|shipping screen]] is displayed, a message is shown saying "An explosion was heard in the night..."

Meteorites don't despawn naturally and require a [[Pickaxes|Gold Pickaxe]] or better to mine. (A Gold Pickaxe requires 7 hits, an Iridium Pickaxe requires 6 hits, and a [[Forge#Enchantments|Powerful]] Iridium Pickaxe requires 5 hits.) They drop 10 [[Iridium Ore]], 8 [[Stone]], and 2 [[Omni Geode]]s, and have a 25% chance to drop a [[Prismatic Shard]].

'''Trivia:''' From [[Version History#1.0|v1.0]] to [[Version History#1.04|v1.04]] of the game (''i.e.,'' from February 26, 2016 to March 1, 2016), the meteorite was gray with no spiky projections.

===Strange Capsule===
After Year 1, there's a 0.8% chance of the strange capsule event being chosen. The event does something only if a randomly chosen tile on the farm is clear and allows item placement. It will emit a small amount of light when placed. Before the [[Secrets#Shipping_Screen|shipping screen]] is displayed, a message is shown saying "A strange sound was heard in the night..."

A unique &lt;samp>UFO&lt;/samp> sound effect plays, and a Strange Capsule appears on a random tile of the farm.&lt;ref name="strangecapsule" /> The strange capsule can be picked up and placed around the farm. It turns into a broken Empty Capsule after about three days (unless it is stored in a chest or inside of the player's inventory), which enables a [[Secrets#Strange Capsule|further Easter egg]]. It can also turn into a broken Empty Capsule if applied with [[Fairy Dust]]. Once this event has happened in a save file, it cannot happen again.

The Strange Capsule cannot spawn on the [[Ginger Island]] farm, but the event may still happen while sleeping in the [[Island Farmhouse]]. In this case, the Strange Capsule will appear as usual in a random location on the mainland farm.

===Stone Owl===
[[File:Stone Owl Random.png|thumb|right|The Stone Owl]]
There's a 0.5% chance of the stone owl event being chosen. The event checks the same conditions as the [[#Strange Capsule|strange capsule event]], though unlike the Strange Capsule, more than one Stone Owl can spawn in a save file and the Stone Owl can appear during Year 1.

An &lt;samp>owl&lt;/samp> sound effect plays, and a unique [[Furniture#Special Items|Stone Owl]] appears on a random tile of [[the Farm]]. This owl is unrelated to the [[Stone Owl]] sold at the [[Night Market]].

The description reads: "It's not clear where this came from, but it looks very fine."

==Personal events==
If no farm event was selected from the above list (regardless of whether the event did something), the game chooses from one of these events instead.

===Child is born or delivered===
:''See also: [[Children]]''
This event is chosen if the player agreed to have a child 14 days ago in the [[#Spouse asks for a child|spouse asks for a child]] event. The child appears in the farmhouse crib the next day.

'''Bug:''' if another event is selected above, the child is never born or delivered.

===Spouse asks for a child===
If married to an NPC:

: This event has a 5% chance of being chosen if the player has been married for at least 7 days, sleeping at home, have at least 10 hearts with their spouse, have the [[Farmhouse|nursery upgrade]], have not [[Carpenter's Shop#House Renovations|removed the crib]], aren't already having a child, and have no children or one child at the toddler age.

: The player's spouse asks them if they want a child. If agreed to, the [[#Child is born or delivered|child is born or delivered]] after 14 days.

If married to another player:

: This event has a 5% chance of being chosen if the player is sleeping at an eligible home and aren't already having a child. A home is eligible for children if it's owned by one of the married players, has the [[Farmhouse|nursery upgrade]], and doesn't already have two children.

: One player is randomly chosen to propose having children; if both players accept, the [[#Child is born or delivered|child is born or delivered]] after 14 days.

In either case, the player can safely decline without repercussions; the event will be rechecked on later nights with the same conditions. See [[Marriage]], [[Children]], and [[Multiplayer#Marriage]] for more info.

===Farm animal birth===
:''See also: [[Animals#Animal Births|Animals]]''
There's a 50% chance the farm animal birth is selected. The event randomly chooses one upgraded [[Barn]] that isn't full (each with a chance equal to ''0.55% * number of animals inside'', ''e.g.,'' 1.65% for three animals), then one random animal in that building. If no building is selected or the animal can't give birth (''e.g.,'' it's a baby or pregnancy is disabled for that animal), the event does nothing.

The selected farm animal in the barn gives birth. A message is shown asking the player to name them.

===Wild animal attack===
:''See also: [[Animals#Wild Animal Attacks|Animals]]''
This event is guaranteed to be chosen if no other event was, but has a 50% chance of doing nothing. The event randomly chooses one [[barn]] or [[coop]] whose door is closed with some animals outdoors (each with a chance equal to ''1 / number of buildings'', ''e.g.,'' 100% for one building and 50% for two). 

A unique sound of dogs plays, and one animal left outside of the selected building disappears permanently. All other animals show a message indicating "Something bad happened last night.", but are otherwise unaffected.

==History==
{{History|1.5|Fixed spawn requirements for the random [[#Stone Owl|Stone Owl]] and [[#Strange Capsule|Strange Capsule]] night events, making them much less rare.&lt;ref name="twitter"/> There is a new Strange Capsule secret.}}
{{History|1.5.3|The Strange Capsule now only spawns once per game. Made the Stone Owl rarer and touched up the sprite.}}
{{History|1.6|Added Strong Wind Storm random event. Changed [[#Meteorite|Meteorite]] drops: added a [[Prismatic Shard]], increased [[Iridium Ore]] from 6 to 10, increased [[Stone]] from 6 to 8, and replaced [[Geode]]s with [[Omni Geode]]s. Rebalanced the crop fairy event: the chance no longer depends on the number of planted crops, it can no longer happen on the last day of the season, and it can no longer choose dead crops to grow. It is also now more likely with a fully grown [[Fairy Rose]].}}
{{History|1.6.3|Reduced rate of the [[#Meteorite|Meteorite]] dropping a [[Prismatic Shard]] from 100% to 25%.}}
