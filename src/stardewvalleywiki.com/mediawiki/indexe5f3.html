'''Quests''' are set objectives that provide rewards when completed. They're kept track of in the quest journal, which can be brought up by clicking the exclamation point icon at the bottom of the date/time display in the upper right of the screen, or by using the hotkey F. Current progress on a quest is shown under the exclamation point as items are collected. Quests are listed in the journal by title, and each quest can be expanded to read the text and requirements for completion. Clicking the X at the top of the window will close it and there's a button under the journal window to cancel the selected quest. 

There are two major types of quests, story quests and Help Wanted quests. Story quests are typically received in the mail, but a few are automatically accepted at the beginning of the game to help teach the player about the game.  Story quests can be completed at any time after receiving them; there is no time limit or expiration date.

==Help Wanted Quests==
[[File:Help Wanted.png|thumb|right|Example of a randomly generated Help Wanted quest]]
Every day (except the first day of the game) the bulletin board outside [[Pierre's General Store]] may have a randomly generated Help Wanted quest that can be completed in exchange for money and sometimes increased [[friendship]] with the quest giver. When a new quest is available, the bulletin board will have a yellow exclamation point floating above it. Rewarded money depends on the number of items/monsters involved, the player's [[skills]], and sometimes a bit of randomness. Once the player has accepted a Help Wanted quest they will have 2 days to complete it, the current day and the next.  

If a daytime [[Festivals|festival]] occurs during the 2-day period, it may not be possible to complete the quest on the festival day, since most shops and homes are "locked".  See the [[Shop Schedules]] page for more information.

===Achievements===
There are 2 [[Achievements]] associating with completing Help Wanted Quests. Note that completing [[#List of Special Orders|Special Order]] quests (both from Mr. Qi and in Pelican Town) count towards the required "Help Wanted" quests.
*Gofer (Complete 10 'Help Wanted' requests)
*A Big Help (Complete 40 'Help Wanted' requests)
Earning these achievements unlocks unique [[Hats]] at the [[Abandoned House]] in [[Cindersap Forest]]. In addition, the day after earning "Gofer", [[Lewis]] will send {{Price|500}} in the mail. The day after earning "A Big Help", Lewis will send {{Price|2500}} in the mail.

===Types===
There are 5 types of Help Wanted quests that can be posted. There is no penalty for accepting a quest and then not completing it.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|style="vertical-align:top; width:100px;"|'''Gathering'''
||[[Clint]] will ask the player to collect copper, iron, or gold ores, usually 20-40, or [[coal]] for him to inspect, or [[Robin]] will ask the player to gather [[wood]] or [[stone]].

Items must be collected ''after'' accepting the quest. Items stored in inventory or chests will not work. It is not necessary to have the requested items in inventory to complete a gathering quest.  Once the required number of items have been gathered (as indicated by the counter in the journal), simply talking to the villager who requested the items is sufficient to complete the quest.
|-
|style="vertical-align:top;"|'''Slay Monsters'''
||Requires access to [[the Mines]].

[[Clint]], [[Lewis]], [[Demetrius]], or the [[Wizard]] will ask the player to slay a random number of a specific monster.

Once the required number of monsters have been slain (as indicated by the counter in the journal), talking to the villager who made the request will complete it.

Note that a villager will never ask a player to slay a monster they do not have access to yet. For example, a quest to slay [[Shadow Shaman]] will never be asked until the player has reached at least floor 80 of [[The Mines]].
|-
|style="vertical-align:top;"|'''Fishing'''
||[[Demetrius]] or [[Willy]] will ask the player to catch from 1-5 of a specific [[fish]] from the current [[Seasons|season]], either to lower the population of that fish or to keep the art of fishing alive.

The reward is the base sell price of the fish &amp;times; the number of fish requested, and the player gets to keep the fish.

Note that it is not necessary to have the requested fish in inventory to complete a fishing quest. Once the required number of fish have been caught (as indicated by the counter in the journal), talking to the villager who made the request will complete it.
|-
|style="vertical-align:top;"|'''Saying 'Hello''''
||[[Emily]] will ask the player to talk to all the people living in the town. Talking to the [[Wizard]], [[Krobus]], the [[Dwarf]], [[Sandy]], [[Kent]], and [[Leo]] does not count toward this quest. This quest will only appear after the [[#Introductions|"Introductions"]] quest is completed.

The player will gain 100 [[friendship]] points with everyone upon completion of this quest.

Note that on day 2, the game does not display which villagers were greeted on day 1, but greeting the same villager twice over the 2-day quest does not count.
|-
|style="vertical-align:top;"|'''Item Delivery'''
||This is the most common type of Help Wanted quest. Any adult [[Villagers|villager]] that the player has met and can earn friendship with will ask for a random item for various reasons.

This item can be:
* A [[Crops|crop]], [[Foraging|forageable]], or [[fish]] from the current season. Items the player does not have access to will not be requested. For example, [[Sandfish]] will never be requested until the player has unlocked [[the Desert]]. [[Purple Mushroom]]s will not be requested until the player has reached floor 40 of [[the Mines]]. However, weather-dependent fish can be requested in any weather.
* A [[Minerals#Gems|gem]], once the player has reached the bottom of The Mines.
* A metal bar, if the player can [[Crafting|craft]] a [[furnace]].
* An [[Animals|animal product]], if the player has an animal that produces it.
* [[Joja Cola]], [[Seaweed]], or [[Green Algae]]

Villagers will reward the player with gold equivalent to three times the item's normal value, which may make Item Delivery quests a more efficient method of earning money from items than [[shipping]] them.  The player also earns 150 [[Friendship]] points with the requesting villager for completing the quest, with the exception of [[Marriage#Divorce|divorced spouses]].

To complete an Item Delivery quest, the player must hand the item to the requestor. Simply having the item in inventory when talking to them will not complete the quest.  ''Note that completing an Item Delivery quest does not count as giving them a [[Friendship#Gifts|gift]].''  

Note: [[Jas]], [[Vincent]], [[Krobus]], the [[Dwarf]], and the player's spouse will never make Delivery requests. [[Sandy]] will make Delivery requests once the player has unlocked [[the Desert]]. If the player has not yet met a villager that villager will not request any items. The chances of an "Item Delivery" quest being available do not increase as the player meets more villagers.
|}

===Prize Tickets===
{{main article|Prize Ticket}}
On the top left of the Help Wanted board is a counter consisting of three stars. A star is obtained each time the player completes a quest. Once three stars are reached, the player will receive a {{name|Prize Ticket|size=16|class=inline}} reward and the counter will reset. The board will indicate when the next quest will reward a Prize Ticket, but it is limited in terms of accuracy, because the player can have multiple quests active, and therefore may receive the Prize Ticket from completing a different quest. Tickets can be exchanged for [[Prize Ticket#Prizes|prizes]] using [[Mayor's Manor#Prize Machine|the prize machine]] located in Lewis's house next to the Town Ledger.

==List of Story Quests==
In addition to quests posted on the "Help Wanted" board, there are several Story Quests unlocked during gameplay.  There is no penalty for accepting a Story Quest involving item delivery and then deleting it from the player's journal without completing it.  Story Quests do not count towards the "Gofer" or "A Big Help" [[Achievements]].

''Note that the game adds 255 [[Friendship]] points for quests that say "1 [[Friendship]] heart", rather than exactly 250 points.''

==List of Quest Items==
Quest Items are items that do not have any use outside of their intended quests, aside from occasional easter eggs.

They cannot be sold. If a quest item is lost, it can be retrieved from the lost &amp; found box in [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]]' house.

==List of Special Orders==
[[File:Special order board.png|thumb|right|The Special Order board in Spring.]]
During a cutscene that is available starting on [[Fall]] 2, Year 1, regardless of the weather, a special orders board is installed in front of the [[Mayor's Manor]]. This board has larger orders that would not be normally found on the Help Wanted board. Unlike Help Wanted requests, these orders are automatically filled without speaking to the requestor. Additionally, the special orders cannot be cancelled from the individual player quest listing, and time must be allowed to run out. Unless specified, the resources needed for special orders must be collected after the special order has been accepted. On orders that require the player to place items in a container, resources collected before the quest was accepted may be placed in said container, however, new resources must still be obtained. For example, 24 pre-acquired eggs may be placed in the Saloon fridge, but 24 more eggs must still be harvested afterwards to complete the order.

New special orders become available on Monday. The maximum timeframe for a special order, if it is accepted on the day it is posted, varies from 7 to 28 days, depending on the special order. However, the allotted time for a special order decreases every day regardless of whether it has been accepted by the player or not. Hence, if the player starts a special order with a maximum timeframe of 7 days on Wednesday, the time given for completion will only be 5 days. If the player starts a special order with a maximum timeframe of 28 days on the 15th day of a month, they will be given only 14 days to complete the order. The table below indicates maximum timeframes.

A new special order can be accepted each week, even if another one is still ongoing; multiple special orders can be active at the same time. 

When doing a special order that requires shipping items, the player can ship the remaining items on the final day. The progress bar only tracks items shipped on previous days and this can create the impression that items shipped need to be shipped before the last day, but they do not.

The table below states whether special orders are repeatable after having been successfully completed. All special orders will show up again if attempted and failed.

If the player partially completes a special order but ultimately fails, the donated goods can be picked up in the Lost and Found box in [[Mayor's Manor|the Mayor's house]].

After completing a special order, the player can collect a [[Prize Ticket]] from the box next to the special order board.  Special orders that have been completed will display a checkmark below the timeframe if they show up on the board again, allowing players to see what orders they have already fulfilled.

|Your task is to make it to level 100 in the [[Skull Cavern]]. However, you can't eat or drink anything while there.
|7 days
|Reach floor 100 of the [[Skull Cavern]] without consuming any food or drink items. This can be done using [[Staircase]]s. 

While this quest is active, [[Slimes#Big Slimes|Big Slimes]] will occasionally spawn with a heart in them that will recover 10 HP when dropped. This doubles to 20 HP if the player has the [[Burglar's Ring]]. Another way to regain health during the quest is to use equipment with passive healing bonuses, such as the [[Vampire Ring]], the [[Fairy Box]], or a weapon with the [[Forge#Combat enchantments|Vampiric enchantment]]. 

Buffs from food or drinks consumed before entering the cavern stay active for their normal duration.

Two easy ways of completing this special order are:
#Buy or brew 669 [[Coffee]] (costing {{Price|200700}}, if purchased from [[The Stardrop Saloon]]) and cook 223 Fresh [[Triple Shot Espresso]].
#Grow 1667 [[Wheat]], turn them into [[Wheat Flour]] (or purchase 1667 wheat flour, costing {{Price|166700}} if bought from [[Pierre's General Store]], or {{Price|208375}} if bought from [[JojaMart]]), then cook 1667 Fresh [[Bread]].

|Give 50 [[List of All Gifts|loved gifts]] in one week. One gift can be given to each villager per day (a total of two gifts per week, per villager), and there are a total of 34 giftable [[villagers]]. Therefore, this quest can be completed in at least two days by gifting all 34 villagers on the first day, then 16 villagers the next day for a total of 50 gifts.

''[[Stardrop Tea]] does not count for this quest.''

{{Collapse|Tips|content=&amp;#32;
* If done long before this quest, building a [[Coop|Deluxe Coop]] filled with rabbits for their universally loved [[Rabbit's Foot]] is a great way to gift every giftable villager in town (with the exception of [[Penny]]). Other [[Friendship#Universal Loves|universally loved gifts]] can also be used, but are much harder to get in massive quantities.
* [[Crystalarium]]s can be used to make [[Diamond]]s, which are loved by 8 villagers. As for the other [[Minerals#Gems|gems]], all of them are loved by at least 3 villagers. The [[Prismatic Shard]] is a special case in that it is universally loved (apart from by [[Haley]]) but it cannot be replicated in a Crystalarium.
* Other items which are loved by at least 3 villagers and are also relatively easy to stockpile are [[Cactus Fruit]], [[Chocolate Cake]], [[Iridium Bar]], [[Pink Cake]] and [[Pumpkin]].
* [[Penny]]'s hate of [[Rabbit's Foot]] can be bypassed with easy-to-obtain loved gifts such as [[Diamond]], [[Emerald]], [[Poppy]], [[Melon]], [[Sandfish]], and [[Books]].

|Family members of the legendary fish have returned to the valley. You have three days to catch [[Ms. Angler]], [[Glacierfish Jr.]], [[Son of Crimsonfish]], [[Radioactive Carp]], and [[Legend II]].
|3 days
|Catch [[Ms. Angler]], [[Glacierfish Jr.]], [[Son of Crimsonfish]], [[Radioactive Carp]], and [[Legend II]]. They can be caught in the same locations as the older generation of fish but the fishing bar is not distinctly marked as it is with the original legendary fish. It does not have to be raining for Legend II to appear, as the original [[Legend]]. 

The same level requirements for the original legendary fish apply for these fish as well. This means that it is impossible to complete this quest without either reaching fishing level 10 or getting there temporarily via [[Buffs]], as that is the level requirement necessary to hook a Legend II, as with the original Legend.

|}&lt;section end="Mr. Qi's Special Orders" />.

==Trivia==
*To fulfill Pierre's Prime Produce special order, you must harvest 25 gold-quality vegetables and you must place 25 gold-quality vegetables in Pierre's special bin. The shipped vegetables need not be the same items as the harvested ones, nor the same type of vegetables, nor all of matching types, nor even vegetables from the same season. All that matters is that you have counts of 25 harvests and 25 shipped.
*Produce harvested by [[Junimo Hut|Junimo]]s will count toward the special orders' harvest only after [[the Player]] retrieves the items from the hut's inventory, produce that remains inside the hut will not be counted. 
*There is an unimplemented quest reward in &lt;samp>Data/Mail.xnb&lt;/samp> indicating [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]] would send {{Price|10000}} apparently after completing 100 Help Wanted quests.
*If the player decides to purchase [[Joja Cola]] instead of [[Fishing]] for it, the cost for one can is 75g, exactly the same as the reward the NPC will give. Therefore, it will net 0 gold, although it might still be beneficial to do it for friendship points and progress towards a ticket.
*Items collected from a [[deconstructor]] are counted toward special orders. For example, "Robin's Resource Rush" can be completed quickly by crafting and deconstructing 20 [[Chest|wood chests]].

==Bugs==
* Once the Dark Talisman quest appears in the Journal, visiting Krobus will make the quest disappear from the journal. It is not necessary to enter the Mutant Bug Lair, nor to get the talisman itself to complete the quest. However, these things still must be done to trigger the Goblin Problem quest, enter the [[Witch's Swamp]], and meet the [[Henchman]]. 
* The event that happens at the entrance of the [[Witch's Swamp]] will stall if trees are planted in the path the player has to take to get next to the Wizard, forcing an event skip.
*A divorced spouse may make a "Help Wanted" request. When fulfilling the quest, the spouse will express gratitude before going back to the angry/hurt dialogue.  Fulfilling a quest for an ex-spouse does not grant any [[friendship]] points with the ex-spouse.
*'''Mobile only:''' Wood or stone purchased from the [[Carpenter's Shop]] does not count towards "[[#Robin's Resource Rush|Robin's Resource Rush]]" special order.

==History==
{{History|1.3.27|Added 3 quests related to [[Secret Notes]]:  A Winter Mystery, Strange Note, and Cryptic Note.}}
{{History|1.4|Fixed mail sent for "Aquatic Research" to list the correct reward ({{Price|1000}}). Fixed bugs with "A Winter Mystery": Can now be triggered when exiting the farm from the bottom tiles, can now be triggered while riding a horse.  Removed gathering ore quest exploits (can no longer use existing ore from inventory or chest to fulfill quest).  Reaching floor 25 of the Skull Cavern on the first visit now satisfies "Qi's Challenge". Fixed help wanted quests to read "three times the market value" instead of "two times".}}
*[[Version History|v1.4 or v1.5]]: Green Slimes in the Secret Woods now count towards the "Initiation" story quest.
{{History|1.5|Added The Pirate's Wife quest. Added Special Orders board. Added Mr. Qi's Challenges.}}
{{History|1.5.4|Fixed bug where entering the Skull Cavern would complete the Danger in the Deep quest.}}
{{History|1.6|Added a new quest for Meadowlands farm, and The Giant Stump quest. Quantities requested are increased and more varied for Slay Monster quests. Added a rare Help Wanted quest from [[Emily]] called "Saying 'Hello'". Help Wanted quests now show a tracker for progress. Added a small checkmark icon on special orders you've completed before (only on town special orders board). Any color [[slimes]] may now be killed for the "Initiation" quest (not just green slimes). Introduced bug preventing [[Son of Crimsonfish]] from being caught during the [[Night Market]].}}
{{History|1.6.1|Fixed a few bugs related to quest text. Fixed bug where the Meadowlands farm's quest persists if the farm icon is selected, but another farm was started.}}
{{History|1.6.3|For "Four Precious Stones", the Prismatic Shards now must be earned while the quest is active to count. Increased reward for "Let's Play A Game" from {{Price|10|Gem}} to {{Price|20|Gem}}.}}
