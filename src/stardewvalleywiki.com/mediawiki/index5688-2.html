== Most Helpful Contribution (Especially From New Editors) ==

Hi, I’ve been checking out the recent changes page every so often for a while now in anticipation of the new release and it’s clear that you have a lot on your hands. The “Help Editing” page doesn’t give any pointers towards the kind of changes that would be most helpful to you and the wiki, so '''(a)''' I was wondering if you had any in mind (or if there’s a “wanted tasks” list that I missed!)

Two more related questions - 

'''(b)''' if a user spots vandalism before you get to it, do you prefer that they leave it to you or revert the change?

'''(c)''' the “help editing” page says that changes in formatting should be applied across all languages. What exactly does that encompass? I assume new information can be added to only one language, but what about adding a new section to an article?

And finally, one question that is only partially related - '''(d)''' do you think it could be worth adding a note to Emily’s page explaining why Clint isn’t one of her friends, as this seems to be a common cause of confusion and incorrect edits? I’m sure this is on her talk page but it may be worth adding to the actual page for those users who only read the wiki. --[[User:Gravy|Gravy]] ([[User talk:Gravy|talk]]) 22:27, 2 January 2024 (UTC)

:Hello Gravy! I haven't had a "help wanted" list since v1.3, so, no, there's nothing I can point you to. After v1.6 releases, it's going to be a free-for-all, so knock yourself out then (so to speak). :D
:You should clean up vandalism if you see it. If a vandal has made several changes to a page, that involves hitting the "undo" link multiple times, starting with the most recent change, and working backwards. It's time-consuming and can be confusing looking through the version history list, but that's the best way to ensure information isn't changed or lost in the process. If I come along later and see something has changed, I may revert the cleanup and then revert the vandalism, because I have access to more powerful links to do so. You should ''not'' take it personally! I appreciate vandalism clean-up!
:Changes to existing formatting require discussion, adding a new section (if it's substantial) should also be discussed. When version 1.6 is released, new information will be added without discussing formatting, as people discover it. New pages and sections will be added, and no one is expected to add them to all 12 languages. But until then, formatting changes encompass everything on the wiki.
:As for Emily and Clint, they may well be friends after v1.6 is released. There is new dialogue being added, so we may (or may not) see more of their relationship being revealed. I don't know. The basis for "friendship" was always "if they give a gifting hint, they're friends, otherwise not." But I added [[Friendship#Gift Preference Dialogues|a table]] for that and removed the field from the infobox on each villager's page, so their friendship is subjective and open to interpretation now. I don't think we need to take action until after v1.6 is released.
:I'll update [[Help:Editing]] to reflect that some of the "rules" don't apply to version 1.6 as well. Happy Farming! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:44, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

== Quarry Floors in The Dangerous Mines ==

In [[The Mines]], [[The Mines#Dungeon Floors|dungeon floors]] are a type of floor that spawns in [[The Mines]] after [[The Player]] enters the [[Quarry Mine]] for the first time. The floors spawn [[Haunted Skull]]s, [[Slimes|copper]] and [[Slimes|iron]] slimes, [[Mining#Copper Node|copper]] and [[Mining#Iron Node|iron]] nodes. I added a blurb to the [[The Mines#Dungeon Floors|quarry]] section of the [[The Mines|Mines Page]], just so you know. Have I done something wrong when doing this? [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 5:57, 5 January 2024 (UTC)
:I cleaned up the language a bit, but otherwise it's fine. Thanks for your contribution! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:10, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

== The Main Page not updating its image ==

In the [[Stardew Valley Wiki|Main Page]] of this Wiki, it has an image to the right of the Stardew Valley logo, which changes depending on the month of the year, the main page image changes to "Banner Right Winter" in the following months: December, January, and February. This is an image of [[1 River Road|George's House]] in [[Winter]]. And in December of 2023, the main page image didn't get updated. Should we set up a code in the Wiki where it automatically updates the main page image, instead of you editing the page too many times? [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 4:51, 8 January 2024 (UTC)
:Thanks for the reminder! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:21, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

== Missing Link ==

It seems that a link to the [[Bus Stop]] page on the [[Stardew Valley Wiki|Main Page]] is missing, can we get a link to the [[Bus Stop|Bus]] page on this page? Because it is considered a location in the Valley section in this Wikipedia page. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 5:05, 13 January 2024 (UTC)

== Harvey 4-heart and 8-heart Events ==

Margot, on 31 Dec 23 you reversed an edit by 9000 that stated Harvey needed to be in the clinic in order to trigger the 8-heart event. Are you sure? I have documented (privately) that his presence is required for both 4-heart and 8-heart events. I think that game behavior disagrees with the event file. Perhaps there's a bug? [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 18:49, 15 January 2024 (UTC)
:The game files are pretty clear: Harvey needs to be at the Clinic for the 4-heart event but not the 8-heart event. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:11, 15 January 2024 (UTC)

== You commenting to edits in all caps ==

Hello Margot, in the 9000 talk page, you made a discussion about us commenting in all caps, and you told us to stop doing it, you do this when you edit sometimes, when you're shouting at Users to stop doing something, like adding too many links, adding gibberish, etc. You did not answer my topic for the [[Bus Stop]] link in the [[Stardew Valley Wiki|Main Page]], or [[Battery Pack]]s in the [[Mutant Bug Lair|Bug Lair]], why don't you answer somebody's topic sometimes? Please explain Margot. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:53, 21 January 2024 (UTC)

== Periods after Reference Links ==

Hello Margot, in many pages in the Wiki, they have References, but for some reason, if there is a Reference Link at the end of a paragraph, you put the period right after it instead of before it. Please reconsider doing this. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 06:11, 21 January 2024 (UTC)

== Steam Achievements Work When SMAPI is Launched as a Non-Steam Game ==

On the "Modding:Installing SMAPI on Windows" page, it says it is currently untested as to whether Steam achievements work when SMAPI is launched as a non-steam game. 
I tested it out and got a video of it working! I can't post an external link here, but if you're interested then let me know how I can send it to you.
[[User:Milkants|Milkants]] ([[User talk:Milkants|talk]]) 00:46, 31 January 2024 (UTC)
:I'm confused as to why you posted this here, Milkants... Please go ahead and edit the modding page, and place a comment on its talk page saying the video is on youtube, and the video id is D5ooOUCDnAY. ok? Thank you, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 03:28, 31 January 2024 (UTC)

== Latest revisions of the [[Milk Pail]] and [[Shears]] pages ==

Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], in the [[Milk Pail]] and [[Shears]] pages, the latest revision for these pages are both 16 February 2020, at 15:21. No Users have changed these pages for almost 4 years now, just so you know about it. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:51, 4 February 2024 (UTC)

== Uploading Files to v1.6 ==

[[File:Rotten Plant.png|thumb|left]][[File:Rotten Plant 2.png|thumb|right]]Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], since v1.6 is right around the corner, there's gonna be a lot of files that need to be uploaded, including 12 different languages. Who's gonna do all of the files? Is it gonna be [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:margotbean|talk]]) or [[User:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]] ([[User talk:Pathoschild|talk]]) (This is an example because they're both translators)? Also noticed that the Spoiler tag has updated, it now uses [[Rotten Plant]]s instead of [[Buffs#Jinxed|Jinxed]], instead of warning just Mobile Players, it is now warning all Players, just so I point this out because it is gonna be a big day for the Wiki for the release of v1.6. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 08:57, 7 February 2024 (UTC){{Clear}}

== Fertilizer ==

I'm glad I found an acceptable edit for my recent findings about Deluxe Retaining Soil. Since then, I've continued some investigations and think I may have more to distribute across various articles on the subject, but I'm not likely to find a way to make those edits that wouldn't be disruptive in the context of the v1.6 release, so I will be holding off. I also need to formulate just what it is I ought to say, so I have no material to look at right away. And I hear that v1.6 may be close? So, just a heads up that something's pending with me, and it might affect structures within somewhat (not sure). I do find there's not much said about fallow but tillable soil, and that whole subject does have implications for fertilizer, so I've got to look around and find where that belongs. All the best for v1.6! [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 20:43, 13 February 2024 (UTC)
:Thanks for the heads up! You may find that I'm so frazzled, I don't care what you change... (Don't tell anyone, though!)
:I don't know how close v1.6 is, there are a fair few bugs to be fixed, but when it's released you might find some things have changed with regard to fertilizer. The alpha change notes ([[Modding:Migrate to Stardew Valley 1.6#Vanilla release notes]]) already contain a change to tilled soil underneath [[Crafting#Seeds|seasonal Wild Seeds]] on Ginger Island, so if you're going to deal with those type of seeds, there may be even more changes with v1.6. You may find a bug specific to v1.6 as well, although I hope not.
:Anyway, thanks again for the heads up. Please proceed with your project, and have fun! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 23:00, 14 February 2024 (UTC)

::And thanks for the v1.6 heads up, too. I think now that the best approach won't end up changing article structures much: perhaps a new section, once, mostly paragraphs and/or sentences. So that doesn't look too serious. "V1.6 close" is what I've been hearing since November, so I think I won't wait. Who knows when it will be, really? A Wild Seeds change sounds like a special case wrt the stuff I've been digging up - a detail, not a basic behavior. Should be a small change once it comes. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 00:25, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

== Reversing revisions with links ==

Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], in my [[Special:Contributions/9000|Contributions for 9000]], there are a bunch of revisions of lowercasing links, we previously changed lowercase to capitals, but you didn't like that and got cross, we then started lowercasing every link there exists, but you are reversing our edits without giving a reason. Can you please stop doing it? Are you reversing yourself now, do you think that lower is caps now, or do you just not like changing links? Please reply and thank you. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 08:14, 16 February 2024 (UTC)
:Your edits are not productive, they do not improve the wiki, but they do make more work for me at a ''very'' busy time. It's clear that you're not a native speaker, and you make many mistakes that I have to clean up. If you have no new information to add, or an obvious typo to fix, please stop making edits. I understand that you may feel the urge to contribute, but you are simply not helping to make the wiki better. Thank you. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:41, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

::Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], I promise I'll stop doing edits like this, but the reason that this was done is because English only uses capitals for the start of a sentence or proper nouns, such as [[Villagers|Villager]] names in Stardew Valley. If you use too many capitals in a sentence, it may lose the flow of writing in English, due to how many capitals there is. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:41, 18 February 2024 (UTC)

== Enforcing Rules that don't exist ==
Something strange has caught my attention in my two days of being on the Stardew Valley wiki. Every single edit of mine has been deleted or reversed. Strange?... I look at the revision history of all the changes I have made, and something strange sticks out to me. All of the changes done by you? What a coincidence! So my intuition tells me that "maybe I'm breaking some sort of rule?". So I go onto the "help page" but when I scroll down to read it I don't see a single rule stating that what I did was wrong? 

Here are some of the rules I have "broken"..

*as both a Console and PC player, I noticed that some features available on PC are not available to be accessed on Console (e.g., Some Profile Easter eggs like clicking on Haley's picture) . So, to be helpful, I added a little bit of info, so console players don't get stuck trying to do something that they can't do. And no, it's not a bug. You physically cannot click on the pictures for a reason. It would be frustrating if, instead of scrolling through two options (scroll left, scroll right), there was a middle option that didn't do anything useful other than waste your time.
*the glitches page: You had a discussion? No, you didn't. I can see past logs. You know that, right? You came to an agreement with yourself that that page shouldn't exist. Adding onto that, your original gripe with the first version of the page was that it was dedicated to a single glitch. My new page was devoted to a plethora of glitches not jus the single one you had a problem with.
* Guys can get pregnant. Yeah, you heard that? Not every person who sets their farmer to male has a pair of testicles. If I were a trans guy, I think I would like to know if my farmer is getting pregnant or my spouse or if I had an option.
*I literally uses the exact same format as the other info on the heart event page.

Honestly I feel like It would make everybody's life's easier if we had an actual formatting rules page instead a single page that doesn't really say mutch.

:If you read the sections on Editing and Formatting, you may notice that large-scale changes need to be discussed first. As for the rest, you will find that getting upset will get you nowhere.
:If players using a controller cannot access the villagers' moving portraits, that's a bug that needs to be reported on the forums. It's most definitely not intentional.
:If you wish to take up the issue of gender with ConcernedApe, you wouldn't be the first. I suggest you use the forums or email him. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:21, 17 February 2024 (UTC)

== [[Golden Egg|Golden eggs]] from [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|fishing treasure chests]] at low [[fishing]] levels ==

Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], in the [[fishing]] page, the [[Golden Egg|golden egg]] is one of the possible rewards from [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|fishing treasure]], with this item, it can be processed in [[Mayonnaise Machine|mayonnaise machines]] to produce 3 gold quality [[mayonnaise]], or it can be put in the [[incubator]] to hatch the [[Golden Chicken|golden chicken]]. This item requires [[perfection]] to be able to appear in [[Fishing#Treasure Chests|treasure chests]]. Leveling up all of the [[skills]] to the max is required to reach [[perfection]], though the page says that you need [[fishing]] level 2 or more to snag this item, it can only be caught when [[The Player|the player]] reaches [[perfection]]. This is very interesting in the page, please reply. Thank you. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 09:45, 21 February 2024 (UTC)

== [[Emily]] at [[Emily#Two Hearts|2 Hearts]] ==

In [[Emily]]'s [[Emily#Two Hearts|2 Heart cutscene]], which is triggered by entering [[2 Willow Lane|Emily's House]], the Wiki used to be incorrect. It used to say ''Enter Emily's house.'' This cutscene cannot be triggered when [[Emily]] is not at her house. The user [[User:Clashccc|Clashccc]] ([[User talk:Clashccc|talk]]) corrected the page, you need to enter the game's code to see if it is actually true. The page ''[[User:Margotbean/HeartEventTriggers]]'' used and still says it right now, it says ''[[2 Willow Lane|Emily's House]]''. This needs to be corrected. Thanks.

== 1.6 Release Date ==
Hi, I have two quick questions - 1) concernedape's twitter seems to say v1.6 will be released on the 19th, but in your above reply you said 21st. Did I miss something somewhere? (just wanted to make sure both for myself and in case you accidentally had the wrong date down!) 2) is it worth adding the release date to the main page? I know this is something you would have to do and it's only two weeks away, so it may not be, but not everyone has an X/twitter account and seeing the announcement tweet is difficult without it for some reason (I had to follow a link from an article to see it). [[User:Gravy|Gravy]] ([[User talk:Gravy|talk]]) 01:22, 3 March 2024 (UTC)
:Difficult, yes. I have tried the same and was unsuccessful. And I refuse to create social media accounts for myself since they are too much overhead in my life.

== [[Stone Golem]]s ==

Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margot]], in the [[Adventurer's Guild#Monster Eradication Goals|Monster Eradication Goals]], the category for Cave Insects includes [[bug]]s, [[Bug (dangerous)|dangeous bugs]], [[Cave Fly|cave flies]], [[Cave Fly (dangerous)|dangerous cave flies]], [[grub]]s, [[Grub (dangerous)|dangerous grubs]], [[Mutant Fly|mutant flies]], [[Mutant Grub|mutant grubs]], and [[Stone Golem|stone golems]]. But what this is talking about is the [[Stone Golem|stone golem]], prior to v1.5, the [[Monsters|monster]] used to be named Zombies, and had their own category, but this is very odd, if you killed this [[Monsters|monster]], it wouldn't apply to the Cave Insects category, but to the Zombies category. The Zombies category was removed and applied to Cave Insects to v1.5. [[User:9000|9000]] ([[User talk:9000|talk]]) 05:58, 8 March 2024 (UTC)

== [[Random Events#Meteorite|Meteorites]] in [[multiplayer]] ==

The [[Random Events#Meteorite|Meteorite]] that spawns on [[The Farm|the farm]] is a [[Random Events|random event]] that has a 1% chance of being chosen when [[The Player|the player]] sleeps overnight. The meteorite appears in a random location within the farm and destroys any [[crops]] or [[Crafting#Decor|crafted flooring]] within that area. If you mine a meteorite, it drops 6 [[Iridium Ore|iridium ore]], 6 [[stone]], and 2 [[geode]]s, but if you play in [[multiplayer]], the amount of items dropped counts towards how many people are playing, such as playing with ''4 players'' drops 24 iridium ore, 24 stone, and 8 geodes, which also allows four [[Iridium Bar|iridium bars]] to be smelted in a [[furnace]], instead of just one iridium bar as an extra note.

== Crafting Ingredients ==
Thanks for your message. I didn't realize 1.6 was coming out so soon or I probably would have waited. And I also didn't realize big changes have to be approved first. Yes, I found the cooking ingredients so helpful on that page that I copied that format. One reason I think my format is better than a short list as in your example is I find it very helpful to have the items divided by category and with their seasons specified. Then I know that in Spring I need to get certain crops, for example, or these are all the things I need to get from the mines. And there's a precedent for that format, and also for having it on the same page, on the cooking page as you mentioned. If I were going to put those ingredients on a separate page, then I think the cooking ingredients should also be moved to a separate page for consistency. Shouldn't those two pages be consistent? I know that my longer format is a tremendous amount of work (and it was) which is probably why it hadn't been done before, but other than it almost being out-of-date, since someone's done it, could the update stand once I've edited it for 1.6? Thanks for your appreciation, btw. I made a similar update on the RSV wiki for a lot of information that was missing on the quests page and my changes were reverted without any message or explanation. Never played RSV again, lol. [[User:Susb8383|Susb8383]] ([[User talk:Susb8383|talk]]) 21:16, 17 March 2024 (UTC)
:Yes, yes, and yes. Oh, and I'm sorry about the RSV wiki!
:Yes, your longer format is fine if you feel it's helpful, and yes, we can build the tables once v1.6 is released. I would strongly prefer a link to the page, so that the page would be "Crafting/Ingredients" (a sub-page of Crafting) and then a simple link to it under a heading "Ingredients". 
:And yes, the [[Cooking]] page should be the same! Unfortunately, there is only one of me, and 12 languages to try desperately to keep cohesive. With all the 1.6 changes (and all the daily changes across all 12 languages), moving ingredients to a separate page has been pushed to the bottom of the "to do" list. One of us could easily do it in English, but then what about the other languages? It's a relatively simple change, someone just has to find the correct translation for "see [this page]" and then move the section. It sounds straight-forward, but around language #6 you start to think "Wowsers, this is a lot of work, did I make a mistake in German, oh geez, I have to check that" and then you lose your place... Well, it gets complicated very fast. Having said that, if you want to attempt that change in all 12 languages, that would be stupendous. (!!)
:Otherwise, we'll concentrate on [[Crafting]] for now, start creating the tables in 2 days, and then migrating the changes to the other languages will be part of v1.6 changes, more likely for translators to pick up and do themselves.

i noticed that you deleted a page i just created because of the name, which is understandable as it's not a great name. i just picked that name because these boxes have similar interaction like the first package upon starting a new save for the first time. should i just cover the details of these boxes in the respective locations' pages for now, or do i hold on to them for now until a page is decided for it?

== Mossy Seed - Tree Variations ==

Hello, sorry in advance for the confusion but I have planted my mossy seed and saw it grow into a large all-green mossy tree, and went through the game's .xnb files and found the images for it. The tree was simply named tree 3 Green Rain, and when tapped it produced fiddlehead fern. I added this information to a Mossy Tree page, and another user alerted me that their mossy seed had grown into a different tree, which when they looked into the .xnb files for, they found under tree 1 Green rain. Their tree cannot be tapped like mine, but it spreads seeds around it (whereas I'm not sure mine does). Now we have these two confirmed (but separate) trees that grow from the same seed, with a possible third variant (the file tree 2 Green rain) coming from the mossy seed as well. It seems that these are called the Fiddlehead Stalk (tree 3 Green rain) and the Wild Tree (tree 1 Green rain), but I'm not sure how to validate the legitimacy of these names...? Right now the Fiddlehead Stalk is named under the Mossy Tree page, and I was wondering if there was a way to update it to a new name once one is confirmed, and also on how to proceed with formatting when 1 seed can produce many variants of a tree. Should it be three separate tree pages, or one page with all of them? Thank you so much for any guidance.
:Hello anonymous editor! The fact is, there is no in-game name for these trees, and I don't know what to call them to differentiate them from other trees that have moss on them. If we stick to the game files, then they are "Green Rain Trees". They all start with the green rain event. 
:I think we should discuss the proper name for them, and try (try!) to decide quickly, before the name gets copied into 11 other languages and becomes an indelible part of history. If we have already decided on "Mossy Tree" then we need to be explicit about the difference between a "Mossy Tree" and a tree with Moss on it. Because "Mossy Trees" come with and without moss on them. 🥴 [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:44, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
::Just chipping into this discussion, I agree that calling is Mossy Tree is a bit confusing with the other trees which can also have Moss on them. I think this name comes from the fact that these trees can be grown using [[Mossy Seed]], which is a bit of a misnomer since its not necessarily moss related. Perhaps 'Green Rain Trees' is the best we can do.[[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 17:23, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
:::Adding my bit since I've been helping do some research and editing for the Mossy Seed and Mossy Tree Wiki pages.  From what I've seen, The trees have been labelled as the Fiddlehead Stalk and the Wild Trees(as there are two of these variations) by the community.  The other editor and I were in the process of asking an admin(not sure who) how to handle formatting of a seed that produces 3 variations of tree, but the Mossy Tree wiki page seems to be no more.[[User:Tmh|Tmh]] 3:08 PM, 23 March 2024 (CST)
::::i was gonna suggest to name the new tree just "wild tree" as it's mentioned in both the mossy seed and mushroom log's descriptions (that log seems to work the best with these trees), but i'm not sure now since those other seed trees could also be considered "wild" 😅 [[User:Sooji gooji|Sooji gooji]] ([[User talk:Sooji gooji|talk]]) 21:30, 23 March 2024 (UTC)
:::::&lt;s>Hey, there's been a discussion [[Talk:Green Rain Trees|here]] about various "Green Rain Tree" things, but I'll repeat my latest post there. "I'm just now realizing that the term "Mossy Tree" was removed and replaced with Green Rain Trees, but I personally believe that it should be reverted. I feel like that is what it should logically be called, and "Green Rain Trees" seems sort of weird, considering that they come from other sources besides that event. We can just put one of those notes at the top of the pages that says "Not to be confused with trees covered in moss."" Additionally, some of the specific variations are considered "Wild Trees" so that wouldn't work either.

::::::Ok, quick update. I sent out a small poll in the discord, and I have some naming preference results. "Mossy Trees" (with the notice at the top of the page) is unanimously preferred.

::::::::Ok, quite a bit has happened. I feel that it should stay as "Green Rain Trees" so forget everything I said above. This is mainly because "Wild Trees" is a new concept that consists of all trees in the wild. Because of this, '''Wild Tree''' would need to be moved to a page called '''Bushy Mossy Tree''' and '''Lush Wild Tree''' needs to be moved to Leafy Mossy Tree. These Bushy and Leafy adjectives actually come from the game code so it’s official. This also means that the [[Mossy Tree]] page can be changed to a “disambiguation page” (a list of what it may mean) of sorts. I can handle this, as long as you take the protection off that page, though. :) And don't worry-I'll make sure to add plenty of "Not to be confused with..." notices. I know this is a confusing topic, but I believe that this is the least confusing method.

If what im doing is acceptable for the Dried Mushroom ill move onto the other items with gifting once I finish Dried Mushrooms. Thanks.

==1.6 Fish Code changes==
As you may know, 1.6 changed the coding for special fish spawns (e.g. Legendary fish, Night Market fish, fishing presents, etc.). Pre-1.6, their spawns were taken care of in functions called getFish in the game code. However, for most of them, their spawns are now taken care of in Data\Locations.xnb. Upon inspection, very few (if any) of their percentage chances of catching have actually changed. Therefore, I will change all of the necessary getFish references to reference Data\Locations.xnb instead. Letting you know because these changes won't need history sections as nothing related to the actual gameplay changes. Thanks.

Hi Margotbean, I want to try and add a new template to make it easier to include a reference to a specific mastery, like &lt;pre>{{Mastery|Farming}}&lt;/pre> which would then generate an icon and a link to the mastery page. I'm not familiar with creating templates (yet!), but can I just add and try to get it to work or is there some playground I can test in?

== Inventory, Tabs, Player Menu ==

I'm confused about the use of terminology and the organization of the Wiki regarding matters intersecting these items. "Inventory" has long meant the first tab of (the Player Menu?, or what?), and its page seems to indicate that it's just the first tab. But I'm not sure we're consistent about using "inventory" in that way. We have separate articles for other tabs, some of those new, but where do we describe what a "Tab" really is and where to find it? Inventory? We seem to have no article that draws all the tabs together (no "Player Menu"), to describe such a central UI feature. And isn't "Player Menu" often used as inventory? I think it's all a bit jumbled, and the website lacks sufficient topical articles to help sort out distinctions and separations from unions and conjunctions. Now is as good a time as any to put any changes into practice.

One more element to this: Mastery. The Mastery Tab displays just the Powers of the masteries, not all the effects of them. The [[Mastery Cave]] article certainly could be used to put all mastery features together, but that would probably mean listing the powers there as well, introducing replication, yet the tab needs the info also.

So I'm asking for guidance on how the Wiki should be structured, for all of us. But I'm also asking for terminology intent, that the texts may be clear. It's certainly a bundle!

There's also a little matter of how the player is supposed to be able to track progress towards the next mastery level in-game, when the Mastery Tab doesn't seem to give that information. I've got that on [[Talk:Mastery Cave]] too, but if you know...  Thanks for your patience! [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 02:08, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

:I can address some of that! The player menu refers to the entire set of tabs that pops up in-game when you hit "E" or "Esc" by default. The player tab is the 2nd tab from the left on that menu, right after the inventory tab. It does introduce difficulty, since both terms use "player". But the two are different! Some places refer to it as the "Skills Tab" as well, which isn't awful, but outdated.
:When I get the chance to breathe, I can make more wiki changes. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:43, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

::Thanks! The more I look at it, the more I'm inclined towards the idea of a Player Menu article. I could write up a good intro right now, starting with the clarifications you just gave me. It would need an image - of the default display when it pops up. But that's essentially the "Inventory Screen" section of [[Inventory]] right now, which needs updating anyway. Splitting off that part of Inventory would lead to two short articles, true, but it would also make distinct the shift between global and local foci of topics and emphasize where all the many tab articles are centered. Just a thought. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 18:24, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

::Second thought, in place of the original above. Perhaps Player Menu could be a name redirect in the article space - to [[Inventory]]. Inventory is the way it pops up, and separate sections could be devoted to the two purposes, with the need for only one image to oversee all, and wording to avoid duplications.

== Name change + code reference question ==

Hi, just made this account to make some edits but realized too late I didn't add an "x" to the end of my username to make it "Gofer2x". It's my usual username and I'd prefer to keep it consistent across sites. I've looked online and Mediawiki seems to let admins change usernames, could you change it for me if not a problem? 

Also, I want to dig through the code and add some references to some wiki pages. But if the relevant code is in a bigger function (like several hundred lines long), do I only point to the function or add extra details (e.g. &lt;samp>Foo.Bar::Baz&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>case 35&lt;/samp>? I imagine a line number could also work but it could differ across setups.
:I'm sorry, I'm unable to change usernames. 
:When giving code references, how specific you want to get is up to you. I wouldn't add line numbers or case numbers, because decompilers can change those. But adding something simple like "the use case for 'nameOfCase'" would be fine. 
:Please remember to sign your posts with 4 tildes! Thanks! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 16:30, 29 March 2024 (UTC)

== [[Fish#Legendary Fish|Legendary Fish]] in [[Fish Pond]]s ==

Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]], we was just looking under the different [[Fish#Legendary Fish|legendary fish]], and we noticed that they can be put in [[Fish Pond|fish ponds]] now, as we just noticed [[roe]] and [[Aged Roe|aged roe]] in the different pages. Note that this does not include the [[Fish#Legendary Fish II|Legendary Fish II]].

==Trout Derby edits==
An Error 503 occurred while I was trying to edit the Trout Derby page, so I copied the page with my new edits so it wouldn't get lost. After the errors subsided ~10 minutes later I pasted the new text and submitted but the old text didn't get fully deleted for whatever reason which resulted in duplicating content. I fixed that immediately afterwards. Just letting you know in case you were wondering about those edits. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 22:48, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

==Parrot Egg missing info==
Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]], I noticed that Parrot egg page was missing some crucial information (lack of which made me personally stressed out until i found out), so I added it in. I am unsure whether my writing style is up to the standards, but I beg you not to remove that information. The game does not reforge the trinket if your total earnings are under 750,000. But it still takes the materials. It feels like it is a bug, as nowhere it is mentioned that you must have earned a specific amount of gold before being able to have a higher level companion. I believe its for everyone's benefit to keep that information. I have messaged you on discord for better communication, as I am open to discussions or changes that I have to make in order to keep that information on the page. [[User:Silentjunimo|Silentjunimo]] ([[User talk:Silentjunimo|talk]]) 21:24, 31 March 2024 (UTC)

==Adding 1.6 items to [[Template:Collections_Items_Shipped]]==
Hello [[User:Margotbean|Margotbean]], I noticed that the [[Collections]] page, and the template it uses, [[Template:Collections_Items_Shipped]], was not updated yet. Specifically, the Items Shipped, Fish, and Cooking sections. I went to go update the image File:Shipping_Page_1.png, but the image didn't change after uploading for some reason. Thankfully it didn't change, since I realized a couple of minutes later that [[Template:Collections_Items_Shipped]] was protected. I did try to undo it, but it wouldn't let me (I guess only admins can do that?). So, I was wondering if you could undo that edit? And, if possible, maybe allowing edits on [[Template:Collections_Items_Shipped]] so that it can be updated?

Hello @Margotbean, I am using the Nintendo Switch version of Stardew and I have noticed that the template does not match the shipping tab on the console version, specifically the clam is missing from the bottom of page 1 between the juice and the poppy. I don't know if this is something that has come from previous versions, or if the clam is removed in the latest update (which we console players do not have as yet). Could you advise?

== Redirects ==

I've been adding some redirects to the wiki and you've been deleting them. Personally, I think the redirects provide a tremendous amount of value. However, since you've been deleting them, presumably you think they are just clutter and/or not necessary. Would you allow me to possibly convince you otherwise? As a basic example, take the case of "book seller". If I type that into the wiki, it currently [https://imgur.com/a/fDK1KVo looks like this], giving 0 results and giving the appearance that such a thing does not exist on the wiki at all. However, of course that is a lie, because the page "Bookseller" exists. This is confusing because in normal English, "book seller" is always separated as two words. The only reason that it is different on the wiki is because ConcernedApe made a typo / grammatical error when implementing it into the game, and the wiki explicitly follows the in-game conventions.

You could imagine a scenario with a user being something along the lines of: "Oh, the Book Seller is in town today. I remember from last time that they sell rare books, but I don't remember anymore which specific ones that are sold. No problem, let me look that up on the wiki! [types in "book seller", gets no results]. What the heck? I guess the wiki doesn't have any information on the book seller yet, so let me just do a Google search for "stardew book seller" and see what I can find. [does Google search] Wait a second, the Google search just pointed me back to the wiki. Oh, I see the problem now, bookseller is one word on the wiki. That's really annoying!"

We can fix up this user story with a redirect. By making "book seller" redirect to "bookseller", we can plant users exactly where they expect to be with 0 friction. Perhaps we could call these type of redirects "search redirects", which have the explicit goal of saving the user time or preventing a second click and/or a second google search. Unfortunately, I know that such "search redirects" will show up in the MediaWiki admin tools as "orphaned pages" that don't link anywhere else, which will make them show up alongside other legitimate pages that do need to be deleted. However, I think that search redirects provide so much value that they should be excepted. Please consider this request. --[[User:Zamiel|Zamiel]] ([[User talk:Zamiel|talk]]) 10:14, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

: Hi, to your specific mention of "Bookseller" - the word ''does'' exist in English; it is a noun that is defined as the proprietor of a bookstore or one who sells books. (https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/bookseller) ConcernedApe did NOT make a typo or grammatical error. 

:So, while redirects might be useful in some circumstances, for this one, it is moot. [[User:Rogue.toast|Rogue.toast]] ([[User talk:Rogue.toast|talk]]) 21:01, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
:: My inquiry is not just about bookseller. It is about "search redirects" more generally. Search redirects provide value regardless of whether or not the word exists in a dictionary. I could come up with some equally compelling example that does not exist in the dictionary. e.g. Joja Mart --> JojaMart --[[User:Zamiel|Zamiel]] ([[User talk:Zamiel|talk]]) 23:48, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

== Version History edit revert ==

I would like to ask why [[Special:Permalink/164004|my edit]] on the Version History page was reverted. I feel like I wasn't doing anything wrong, my edit was constructive (I added a ton of links that readers can immediately visit in order to read more info on things mentioned in the changelog), and I even removed an inaccurate edit (eg. [[Meowmere]] is not mentioned anywhere on the official changelog because it is secret, but it is listed on the wiki's changelog). [[User:Anzasquiddles|Anzasquiddles]] ([[User talk:Anzasquiddles|talk]]) 18:30, 3 April 2024 (UTC)
:Removing info, even if you feel it's a secret, is cause for reverting it. You also linked to a lot of redirects instead of main links. I don't have time to pick through each sentence with the influx of edits, and trying to prepare updated content offline, so the entire edit got reverted. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 19:08, 3 April 2024 (UTC)

== Scythe ==

Hey there, on my last edit I just removed the section that stated, "If it is lost (by dying in the Mines, for example), a new one should spawn the next morning, either next to the bed or in the refrigerator." which I mentioned in my edit history. In the 1.6 update ConcernedApe fixed this issue, so that none of the scythes can no longer be lost. 

Ps. I understand that you don't want 1 page for all the scythes, but I thought it might be better to just update the pages individually. For example the Iridium Scythe page does not state that with it "upgrade" (obtaining it) its chance of chance of adding a piece of hay to the silo, when cutting grass goes from 75% to 100%. (when compared gold scythe to iridium) I was just gonna focus on changes like that. To make sure all the information is updated and relevant.

== GiftHeader displays outdated info ==

hi boss&lt;br>as of 1.6, several villagers have new dialogue when given gifts on their birthday (Jas, Vincent, Penny, Shane, Lewis...). the GiftHeader tag does not account for this and still shows the old generic dialogue. i assumed the most elegant solution was to simply remove the GiftHeader tag and manually write in the info it displays, including the new dialogue, but I've been shouted at for attempting this. will GiftHeader be updated to account for the new dialogue?

:Hello DrDean (remember to sign posts with 4 tiles, plz!), sorry for the shouty caps. The answer to your question really depends on whether or not someone wants to update the template in all 12 languages. Today is the first day I'm able to access the wiki without errors since v1.6 released, so I can tentatively start to make template changes, but there are several ('''several''') changes to be made. So, do you know what a switch/case is? Do you have any interest in changing the template in all 12 languages? [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:06, 11 April 2024 (UTC)

::it's alright, i understand the frustration. this is my point though - it seems like more hassle than it's worth to update the template to account for every edge case. unfortunately i'm monolingual and have a very loose understanding of wiki formatting so i won't be much help with it. perhaps the part of GiftHeader that contains birthday dialogue could be removed, and each villager's page could have their respective birthday dialogue written in manually? so it would look like &lt;nowiki>==Gifts==, then {{GiftHeader}}, then 'For loved or liked gifts, Jas will say...' etc.&lt;/nowiki> i would happily do this for the English wiki but unfortunately i won't be much help for any of the translations.

::::i could do that then, with your permission? i suppose i don't need to understand the language to remove info. this would leave the non-English wikis without any birthday dialogue for a while until a proper translator wrote it in, but if you're okay with that i can go ahead and change the template(s). [[User:DrDeanDingleman|DrDeanDingleman]] ([[User talk:DrDeanDingleman|talk]]) 02:33, 20 April 2024 (UTC)
:::::NO. The translations are in data files and must be added to the template. I appreciate your desire to help, but this is not a "starter template", it's advanced. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 17:54, 20 April 2024 (UTC)
:::::: Would it be helpful in the meantime to collect the custom birthday dialog for each language? I don't know how to access data files, but anyone can copy it down by switching the language in-game, as long as they know enough about the language to write it accurately using a keyboard (if it doesn't use a latin alphabet). That way when someone is able to make the changes to the template, they will already have most of the missing data.

== Flooring Images and Icons ==

Hey, thought I should let you know that you missed the majority of new Flooring options added in 1.6. 32 regular, numbered flooring options were added in 1.6 (in "walls_and_floors.xnb"), in addition to the 9 "MoreFloors:X" floors. I'd address the issue myself, but I'm not sure exactly how you were extracting item icons from the game, given I was unable to find anything other the actual floor textures. These 32 numbered floors are all available from the regular catalogue, between (FL)55 (the pink love hearts one, old highest index floor) and MoreFloors:0 (the new dark wood planks). This also messes up the indexing for floor images, which might require admin powers to fix. [[User:Sicarious|Sicarious]] ([[User talk:Sicarious|talk]]) 13:43, 18 April 2024 (UTC)

Hey there again, I was wondering if you could make a template like the Carpenter's Shop, Casino, etc for the Desert Festival.

Why exactly did you revert my edit of the wicked statue image? The crafting recipe for it gives the variant without red eyes, so I feel that that's the better "default" image for it.

::Because every single use of that image, in both templates and pages, refers to the statue item, which does not have glowing eyes in the Crafting menu, or when it's in the player's inventory, or 99% of the time when it's placed in the world. Which is why I changed the old image and uploaded the previous version under a different name. I fail to see how anything in the images section of Help:Editing is related to this, though I guess I could have added more edit summaries.

==Page for deletion==
Hi, I just noticed that [[Farming mastery|this page]] still exists. The discussion that happened over a month ago appeared to have had the consensus of just having the information on the [[Mastery Cave]] page, so I think it's a candidate for deletion.

==Adding links to Modding:Community==
Hi, I want to add myself to this page as requested by SDV Discord moderators. Unfortunately I'm developing an external tool on GitHub Pages, and therefore linking to it was automatically flagged as harmful. Can you kindly assist?

==Passing out at 2am penalties==
Hi, I recently made an edit on the Day Cycle page to reflect that Marlon finding you at 2am doesn't lose any money. You removed the edit saying that you do indeed lose money to Marlon, but I tested it out several times and got the same result every time. I have proof in screenshots which I uploaded to Imgur, but I currently cannot add external links without admin permission. I want to show you the screenshots, and if you agree with my results, please let me redo the edit.

:No way! Please forgive my incredulity, but this was a bug I reported with the 1.5 beta, and never got a response. Now I wonder which version fixed it? Hmmm...
:Well, I will restore your edit, but it would be nice if ''someone'' could test and figure out if this is a 1.6 change or if it was fixed in v1.5 and I never noticed! Thanks for your message! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:40, 8 May 2024 (UTC)
::Thanks for responding! I just tried to test this out on 1.5.6, but every time I passed out, I was found by someone other than Marlon. I was using an old save file that was still in version 1.5.6, and played around 13 days. I'm not sure why I couldn't get Marlon. Maybe I wasn't progressed far enough in the game? (the old save file is in Fall Year 1, but the adventurer's guild is open so I thought it would work). I would be happy to do more testing if I could get my hands on a 1.5.6 save file that is progressed further to eliminate that possibility. It could be the case that Marlon only finds you if you pass out in Skull Cavern. Thank you for your time :) [[User:Eggfan859|Eggfan859]] ([[User talk:Eggfan859|talk]]) 22:42, 8 May 2024 (UTC)

::::I did a lot more testing on 1.5.6 hotfix #3. I was able to use the save file someone provided me. I found that Marlon can only find you when you pass out in Skull Cavern or on the farm (outdoors). And you don't lose any money to him.

==Prismatic Butterfly==
Hi, I added a file for a gif of the Prismatic Butterfly yesterday but had not edited it to an actual page yet. I had been wanting to add it to the [[Statue Of Blessings]] but was unsure of where to put it or with what formatting to use for it so I had opted to just not make the edit and leave the file page there in case a larger contributer wanted to add it themself. I noticed that it had been deleted due to not having actually been used though. [[User:Endle|Endle]] ([[User talk:Endle|talk]]) 10:51, 10 May 2024 (UTC)

==Dialogues for after green rain==
I think there are dialogues for the day after green rain, as well as the green rain dialogues. I've seen Abigail saying "And just like that, everything's back to normal. It's like magic!", which a dialogue I didn't see in her page. Do you know which file do these dialogues would be in? I can add all villagers' dialogues. Thank you! [[User:Peaw|Peaw]] ([[User talk:Peaw|talk]]) 18:26, 12 May 2024 (UTC)
:Hello Peaw! I used my text editor to search the entire "Contents" folder, and discovered that green rain dialogues can be found in the individual villagers' files, ''e.g.,'' &lt;samp>Characters/Dialogue/Abigail.json&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>Characters/Dialogue/Pierre.json&lt;/samp>, etc. Good luck!

== Trying to add to one of the talk pages got "blocked" ==

I tried to post some information i aggregated to the https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Talk:Luck page but when i hit submit i was shown a cloudflare message saying i was blocked and that i should contact the site owner regarding the issue. I can still view the page but the info i tried to post didn't get added.
:Hello anonymous commentor! There could be 2 things going on:
:#There is an unusual amount of traffic on the wiki today, so try again later...
:#You hit a heuristic error caused by html/C# code already on the page

:::Hello again Aidanamite! I looked at your text file, and the luck skill is unimplemented, but has been in the game code since before release. A lot of unused code was removed with v1.6, but not all of it. I don't think the wiki needs to document the unused code per se, especially since we have implemented code that isn't fully explored or documented, but I appreciate your comment!

::::The luck skill isn't unused. Being able to level it up with xp is, but items like rings and food that increase the luck skill still operate by the rules outlined in my document.
::::Also, i made this document based on the 1.6 code, i haven't looked at the code of prior version so all this information is up to date

== Why were changes reverted? ==

Hi,
I wonder if you could tell me why my changes I made to the Cherry page are gone?

I added a reference to needing dried cherries for the raccoon request. This is helpful if you're trying to decided whether you need a cherry tree or not. I didn't get one because I had already shipped a cherry from my fruit cave and knew it wasn't needed in any recipes. Then I got the raccoon's request for dried cherries which means I needed five and had to buy a sapling and wait.

That's info that someone looking up cherries would want to know.

Can you tell me why my changes didn't stick?

Thanks.
[[User:Susb8383|Susb8383]] ([[User talk:Susb8383|talk]]) 22:49, 18 May 2024 (UTC)
:Any fruit can be chosen for that request, it is random (see [[Giant Stump]]). So, in lieu of placing that request on ''all'' possible pages, we have the complete list on the [[Giant Stump]] page. It does no good to be told you ''might'' need a cherry if you never roll that request. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 00:35, 19 May 2024 (UTC)

==Missing Willy Cutscene==
Hello, I just encountered this cutscene with Willy where he talks about his "old friend" in the back of the door behind him in my new save, but I can't seem to find something about this in [[Willy]]'s page, especially in heart events section. Is this on purpose, or should I add it myself? (I also don't know what the requirements are to get this cutscene, so if you tell me that as well I'll be so happy) Thank you! [[User:Peaw|Peaw]] ([[User talk:Peaw|talk]]) 12:08, 19 May 2024 (UTC)
