{{Quote|Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents’ basement. He is Maru’s older half-brother, and feels like his sister gets all the attention and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get deeply absorbed in his work, computer games, comic books, sci-fi novels, and will sometimes spend great lengths of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn’t know. Could a charming new farmer cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?|[https://www.stardewvalley.net/dev-update-12/ Dev Update #12]}}

==Relationships==
Sebastian lives with his mother, [[Robin]], along with his step-dad [[Demetrius]] and half-sister [[Maru]]. Robin sometimes calls him Sebby. He feels that Maru is treated better than he is, and during Winter will talk about building a snow-goon that Demetrius demands he removes; he will then angrily question what his step-father's problem is.

Sebastian is good friends with [[Sam]]; the two can be found hanging out at Sam's house or at [[The Stardrop Saloon]] playing pool. They also stand together at festivals, along with [[Abigail]]. It is implied that he has a crush on [[Abigail]], after Sam tells the player Sebastian really wanted Abigail to be their drummer "for some reason". Furthermore, if married to [[Maru]], she may sometimes say she "wishes her brother would just ask Abigail out". If married to [[Sam]], he'll sometimes ask if you "think Sebastian and Abigail will ever hook up".

During the [[Flower Dance]], if neither [[Abigail]] nor Sebastian is dancing with the player, Sebastian dances with [[Abigail]].

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 2
 |trigger = Enter Sebastian's room when he's there.
 |details = You find Sebastian working on his computer. He asks you to wait, he needs to finish something. You are given two options, "He is busy, maybe I should leave" or "Stay put". In both options, he quickly finishes his work and then apologizes for making you wait. 

* {{choice|"Ask him what he was working on"|0}} He says he does freelance programming work
* {{choice|"Compliment him on his room decor"|0}} He says "Decorations?... Oh, yeah… thanks. I’ve been sticking posters on the walls for years, I guess it’s kinda cluttered." 

Sebastian receives a notification from [[Sam]] asking to hang out, but Sebastian says would rather not go out. [[Robin]] enters his room moments later, telling him that [[Abigail]] was looking for him and will stop by later. Sebastian asks whether Robin told her that he was working, and Robin says yes, but Abigail decided that she would probably stop by anyway. Robin leaves the room, and Sebastian expresses his irritation that nobody takes his job seriously. 

* {{choice|"Ask him about his career goals"|0}} He says he’s saving up to move to the city. He says he prefers working as a freelance programmer because he isn’t part of the corporate rat race and because he feels more comfortable working behind a computer instead of face to face.
* {{choice|"Ask him why he doesn't want to see his friends"|0}} He says "I like having friends, I just need a lot of time alone to balance out the social stuff. Sam’s the opposite… he goes crazy if he’s alone for too long. Maybe that’s why I like computers so much… They’re engaging, straightforward, and unselfish. Quite the opposite of a lot of people I know."

He then goes back to work, saying "I need to get this module finished by tomorrow."
}}

===Four Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 4
 |trigger = Go to [[The Mountain]] between 11am and 5pm.
 |details = You see Sebastian working on a motorcycle in the garage at his house. He explains that it belongs to him and sometimes he goes for long rides alone far away from Stardew Valley. He suggests the possibility of you one day taking a ride with him, to which you agree or disagree.
{{Choice|That sounds fun.|0}}
:Sebastian responds "Great."
{{Choice|No thanks. That sounds stupid.|0}}
:Sebastian responds "Okay... Nevermind then."
{{Choice|I'm scared of motorcycles.|0}}
:Sebastian responds with one of two dialogues:
:*"Don't worry, I'll make sure to show you the ropes before I let you do anything dangerous."
:*"There's no need to worry... I'll make sure you're safe."
}}

===Six Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 6
 |trigger = Enter Sebastian's room when he's there.
 |details = Sebastian greets you, and invites you to play ''Solarion Chronicles: The Game'' with him and Sam. You play through a scenario, for which you'll be given a score between A and D. You're given a choice of archetype:
* {{choice|"Warrior. I like a direct approach."|0}}
* {{choice|"Healer. I prefer to help others."|0}}
* {{choice|"Wizard. A sharp mind is the most powerful blade of all."|0}}

The classes don't affect friendship, and you can achieve a perfect score with any class:

# Go through the front door.
# Choose to fight the skeleton, then raise your shield.
# Go through the left hallway glowing with a green light.
# Destroy the capsules.
# During the final battle:
#* '''Warrior:''' defend your friends while the wizard is mumbling an incantation. You will be able to attack the boss, and the scenario ends.
#* '''Healer:''' heal Sebastian's wizard. Sebastian is grateful and he defeats the boss.
#* '''Wizard:''' use "Shield Charm" while the enemy is mumbling an incantation. The enemy wizard shoots a beam at Sebastian, but your "Shield Charm" reflects it and hits the enemy in the face, killing it.
}}

===Eight Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 8
 |trigger = Go to the beach on a rainy day between noon and 11pm.
 |details = Sebastian is standing on the boardwalk. He's surprised to see you outside in the rain. He says he's anxious around other people, but he doesn't feel that way when he's with you. He takes out an umbrella and motions you to stand under it with him.

[[File:Sebastian Eight Heart Event.png|400px]]
}}

===Ten Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 10
 |trigger = Go to [[The Mountain]] between 8pm and midnight.
 |details = Sebastian is outside his house. He says he was about to go for a ride on his motorcycle. You join him for a ride, and he brings you to a place he often goes by himself to think about his life while enjoying a view of the city.

If your character is female, he mentions that he doesn't normally bring girls to this place. Otherwise, he admits that he's never felt this way about other guys, but that you're different.

He pulls on his cigarette a few times, and then asks what you think of the city. You have four options, one of which is telling him to quit smoking. Choosing this one causes Sebastian to be briefly annoyed; he says you sound like his mom, then admits that it's a bad habit and he'll try to stop. 

He confesses his true feelings for you, and you embrace under the full moon.

===Group Ten-Heart Event===
{{Hearts|10}}
{{#lst:Bouquet|boys}}&lt;!-- Transcluded from Bouquet page -->

===Fourteen Hearts===
{{heart event
 |hearts  = 14
 |trigger = Go to [[The Mountain]] on a rainy day between 6am and 7pm.
 |details = Sebastian is near the lake when he notices you. He's relieved at your arrival and requests your help to save an injured frog hiding in the bushes. You walk to a bush on his left and shake it, causing the frog to run in Sebastian's direction. He catches it successfully, then examines the frog worriedly; his leg is too injured. You can respond with the following:
* {{choice|"What should we do with him?"|0}}
* {{choice|"It's our new son..."|0}}
* {{choice|"I don't think he's going to make it"|0}}
* {{choice|"Let's nurse him back to health!"|0}}

Sebastian responds based on your choice (teasing you if you say the frog is their son), then he decides to take the frog home with him.

Enter your farmhouse between 6:20am and 7pm the next day to trigger the next part of the event:

Sebastian has replaced his Solarion Chronicles table with a terrarium in his spouse room. He explains that he made the terrarium for the frog, since it couldn't survive in the wild anymore. He's pleased that the frog is in better health, but wonders if it will be lonely. You can respond to him here:
* {{choice|"Why not start a 'frog sanctuary'?"|0}}
* {{choice|"He’ll be fine."|0}}

Choosing the frog sanctuary option makes him enthusiastic about making a haven for frogs, while the latter option has him agree, but still wish the frog had a friend. Another prompt appears:
* {{choice|"Why do you like frogs so much, anyway?"|0}}
* {{choice|"I don't really want this in the house"|0}}
* {{choice|"I'm glad you've found a new hobby"|0}}

If you ask him why he likes frogs, he tells you that he gained a natural affinity for frogs from being out in the rain. If you congratulate him on his new hobby, he enthuses about having a physical hobby and says he might even consider frog breeding.

Telling him you don’t want the frogs in the house makes him firm in keeping them, and tells you that he can do whatever he wants in his spouse room.

After the event, Sebastian's spouse room permanently changes to have a terrarium containing frogs.

==Marriage==
{{main article|Marriage}}
Once married, Sebastian will move into the [[farmhouse]]. Like other marriage candidates, he will add his own room to the right of the bedroom. He'll also set up a small area behind the farmhouse for his motorcycle, and sometimes go there to work on it.

On mornings when Sebastian stays inside the farmhouse all day, he may offer you [[Coffee]].  On rainy days, he may offer you a gift he found in "the caves":  [[Obsidian]], [[Void Essence]], [[Bat Wing]], [[Frozen Tear]], [[Amethyst]], or [[Cave Carrot]].  On New Years Eve (Winter 28), he'll give you a [[Beer]] to celebrate the new year.

{{Quote|The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy. The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner.}}
