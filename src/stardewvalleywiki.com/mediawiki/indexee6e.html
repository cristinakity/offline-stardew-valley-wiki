==Raccoon's Requests Rewards==

I'm not sure if the current table is showing the truth. I got 7 [[Fairy Dust]] on my 7th request and 4 [[Mystery Box]]es on my 8th. Perhaps it depends on the given request what the reward is and there is just a pool of requests you can get? [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 13:45, 25 March 2024 (UTC)
:I took a look at the game code and the rewards are indeed randomized (after the fifth). I will edit the page with the correct information later. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 20:13, 25 March 2024 (UTC)

Possibly inaccurate, or at least misleading to state: "The items requested will always be related to and obtainable in the current season." Racoon is requesting dried strawberries in Spring.

:That's not misleading. Strawberries grow in Spring. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 02:17, 7 April 2024 (UTC)

== When is Fairy Dust available? ==

The page says the Fairy Dust trade becomes available after the 4th request, but I checked then and it wasn't available. It wasn't there after my 5th request either, but it seems like it became available after my 6th request completed. Not 100% sure if that's always the case, but I would like it to be verified.

[[User:Willowlium|Willowlium]] ([[User talk:Willowlium|talk]]) 19:39, 7 April 2024 (UTC)

:Hey! I just checked the code, and you are correct - 1 Fairy Dust can be traded for 1 Mystic Syrup after the 6th request. I'll change that now. Nice catch! [[User:Bluestblur|Bluestblur]] ([[User talk:Bluestblur|talk]]) 17:04, 8 April 2024 (UTC)

== Bundle Layout ==

From what I have checked, it seems that the raccoon quest is basically a bundle. There is even different image for each quest and I think using the bundle layout would fit better? --[[User:Andytampan|Andytampan]] ([[User talk:Andytampan|talk]]) 12:52, 8 April 2024 (UTC)
:Hey, I've taken the liberty to draft it like a bundle setup, see [[User:YuvixAdun/Drafts/Raccoon]], any feedback is welcome before I edit this page with it! [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 06:42, 12 April 2024 (UTC)
::Now live on the page :) [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 19:15, 12 April 2024 (UTC)

== Rewards Are Currently Misleading ==

I'd like to point out that the page is currently misleading. For example, for the third request, it implies that the Raccoon will accept any type of Dried Mushroom, when in reality, it will ask for a specific type of Dried Mushroom. Therefore, we need to specify the exact type of Dried Mushrooms the Raccoon can request (similarly to how we specify the exact types of Smoked Fishes the Raccoon requests for the first request). We also need to change this for the second and fourth request. Hence, I will re-add the Stub template until this is resolved. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 21:03, 21 April 2024 (UTC)
: Hey! I just filled in the specific mushrooms that can be requested in each season. Before I do all the possible fruits and vegetables, I'd like to clarify how the second and fourth requests are determined. I'm a bit confused, because the way I'm reading &lt;samp>Raccoon::addNextIngredient&lt;/samp> is that each case is equivalent to its own bundle, so case 1 (2nd request) will always ask for fruit products (1 Dried Fruit and 1 Jelly), while case 3 (4th request) will always ask for vegetable products (1 Juice and 1 Pickle). Am I misunderstanding this? Thanks in advance! [[User:Bluestblur|Bluestblur]] ([[User talk:Bluestblur|talk]]) 23:33, 21 April 2024 (UTC)
:: Do we really need to list them all? I think for the Smoked Fish this was done because the fish are a subset of the total possible fish in-game, but for the dried mushrooms for instance, any type will do, this might be the same for the pickles / jellies / etc. Not sure if it will add much to list them all here. [[User:YuvixAdun|YuvixAdun]] ([[User talk:YuvixAdun|talk]]) 05:29, 22 April 2024 (UTC)
::: Bluestblur, that's correct. The 2nd request will always just be Dried Fruit and Jelly while the 4th request will always just be Juice and Pickle. I'll change that part right now and then we can add in the exact varieties that work later. YuvixAdun, I'm not sure if you read my original comment, but the way it's currently written implies for example that '''any''' type of Juice works (''e.g.'' like with the Shipping Bin, where any Juice can be shipped). Someone else mentioned that ambiguity which is why I brought this up on the talk page. Therefore, it is worth explicitly listing them all out to avoid confusion, even if it doesn't add much otherwise. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 06:46, 22 April 2024 (UTC)
:::: Great, thank you! [[User:Bluestblur|Bluestblur]] ([[User talk:Bluestblur|talk]]) 14:36, 22 April 2024 (UTC)

==Changing "Raccoon Wife's Shop" to "Trading" on item pages==
(I wasn't completely sure where to put this, so I've put it here.) My proposal is for the "Raccoon Wife's Shop" section on individual item pages (not this page) to have its name changed to the "Trading" section. I believe that this is more consistent with other item pages. If this change is going to be carried out, then now is the time. Any thoughts? [[User:Cheese80|Cheese80]] ([[User talk:Cheese80|talk]]) 17:29, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

:I agree, it should be changed to "Trading" to be consistent. [[User:User314159|User314159]] ([[User talk:User314159|talk]]) 17:56, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

::The changes have now been made. [[User:Cheese80|Cheese80]] ([[User talk:Cheese80|talk]]) 17:31, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

==Requests Table is Incomplete==
My racoon family is requesting dried blue mushrooms and a mudstone for the third quest.  Someone else on reddit said that there was a request for a rusty spoon.  

I get the feeling that it could be any mineral or artifact.
The code is near line 310 of Raccoon.cs:

* ingredients.Add(new BundleIngredientDescription(r.ChooseFrom(new string[3] { "-5", "78", "157" }), 5, 0,

Whatever that means.

[[User:Jeffbell|Jeffbell]] ([[User talk:Jeffbell|talk]]) 03:53, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

:Hey! I'm surprised that you got Mudstone as part of the third request - it's not called by that line you mentioned. If you're curious, it means that the possible items have a category of -5 (all Eggs except Dino), item ID of 78 (Cave Carrot) or item ID of 157 (White Algae). I have no idea why Mudstone would show up - maybe someone else can shed light on that. As for the Rusty Spoon, it is in the pool for the fifth request (or sixth and beyond), so... Again, not sure why that would pop up in the third request. [[User:Bluestblur|Bluestblur]] ([[User talk:Bluestblur|talk]]) 05:19, 1 May 2024 (UTC)

:Perhaps some state got messed up in my 1.5 to 1.6.6 migration
[[User:Jeffbell|Jeffbell]] ([[User talk:Jeffbell|talk]]) 06:01, 1 May 2024 (UTC)
::Hello, admin here. In the interest of not deleting discussions I've rolled back Jeffbell's deletion of this section, but the comment to the deletion was this was not an issue after all. Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:11, 2 May 2024 (UTC)
