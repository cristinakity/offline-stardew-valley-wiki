==General Map Section?==
I think that the '''Lonely Stone''' section of this page could be adjusted to be a general section dedicated to map related secrets. This section should also include a piece about how clicking on the "Sewer Pipe" location plays a shadow person sound effect. The image associated with this section should also be updated to reflect the updated 1.6 map which received minor adjustments that included moving the "Lonely Stone" on the map to be in the same place as the stone by the docks on the beach as opposed to somewhere unseen. [[User:Mishkottik|Mishkottik]] ([[User talk:Mishkottik|talk]]) 23:31, 30 March 2024 (UTC)

==Remove Junimo Plush?==
Should the [[Junimo Plush]] be removed from this page? It seems like this page is intended to be about easter eggs, and the junimo plush isn't an easter egg, it's the solution to a secret note. If that is correct, the secret statues could maybe also be removed from this page because those are more of a puzzle than an easter egg. [[User:PointlessSerpent|PointlessSerpent]] ([[User talk:PointlessSerpent|talk]]) 16:13, 18 February 2021 (UTC)

:I honestly don’t mind if it’s removed. I enjoy it being here but it is a puzzle not so much a secret [[User:The Majik Fireball|The Majik Fireball]] ([[User talk:The Majik Fireball|talk]]) 20:45, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
::I agree. It used to be a secret before 1.3.27 when secret notes didn't exist since the game didn't give any hint or clue anywhere that this item existed or how to get it. After the introduction of secret notes it's just a normal game reward for completing a secret note, such as Stone Junimo and Gold Lewis statue. [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 22:59, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
:::You all make good points, but the secret note isn't required to collect the Junimo plush.  Neither is finding the lost book required for obtaining the secret statues.  I don't think it ''hurts'' anything for them to be on the page, but they could be replaced by links to the corresponding pages.  Personally, I'd prefer them to be on the page in some way, rather than deleting them completely.  The page is called "Secrets" and not "Easter Eggs", after all.
:::Having said that, some of the secret items obtained by fishing are on the page, but I think not all of them are.  There are some inconsistencies there (and with some special furniture) that could be fixed.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:49, 21 March 2021 (UTC)

==Earthbound Reference?==
I feel like the name "Stardew Valley" could be a reference to "Saturn Valley" from Earthbound, but only a thought. [[User:SeanyBoi5|SeanyBoi5]] ([[User talk:SeanyBoi5|talk]]) 11:20, 25 Febuary 2021 (EDT)

==Lonely Stone==
The "lonely stone" secret does not seem to work on Xbox one. Is this wrong? [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 18:26, 4 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva
:It should work by moving the cursor with the right joystick, then pressing A (or possibly X), as outlined on the [[Controls#Xbox One / Xbox 360 Controller|Controls]] page.  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:46, 4 April 2021 (UTC)

You're probably right. I was trying to use the left stick but that didn't work. I'll try it now. [[User:StardewValley4eva|StardewValley4eva]] ([[User talk:StardewValley4eva|talk]]) 18:57, 4 April 2021 (UTC)StardewValley4eva

==Item Spawn Cheat==
I just tested the secret '''item spawn cheat''' and apparently it no longer works to receive the [[Error Item]], since I put an invalid ID number (26 in this case) and when a villager quotes my name, a blank space is left in the dialogue and I don't receive any item. Can anyone else test this to confirm? [[User:JaksStrange|JaksStrange]] ([[User talk:JaksStrange|talk]]) 11:43, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
:Tested with the mentioned ID 73, that id is and gives a golden walnut now. Also tested invalid IDs 26, 27, 996, didn't receive Error items. (PC/1.5.4) [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 14:42, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
:compared 1.5.4 to 1.4.4 a bit and looks like 1.5 added a filter, Instead of just spitting out what the player placed into name/farm/favorite. e.g. there is a new filter &lt;code>string farmerName = Utility.FilterUserName(this.farmer.Name);&lt;/code> before &lt;code>Replace("@", this.farmer.Name);&lt;/code> and apparently also a Dirty word filter in utility.cs. I didn't investigate further but yea, no longer works beyond 1.5 [[User:Dubesor|Dubesor]] ([[User talk:Dubesor|talk]]) 15:31, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

== Spoiler? ==

This page should probably have a spoiler, seeing as it talks about the summit and golden eggs. [[User:Turtlesarecool|Turtlesarecool]] ([[User talk:Turtlesarecool|talk]]) 03:58, 17 October 2021 (UTC)

== Edit UFO shipping screen entry? ==

For the UFO shipping screen it is stated that it cannot take place on the 28th. I recently watched a video that seemed to show this to be false. You can search in YouTube 'hodge podge stardew valley 154' to find the video.

Right at the start of the video the UFO can be seen flying across the screen despite it being the 28th of Winter. The video was uploaded about four and half years prior to me discovering this, so perhaps circumstances allowing the UFO to appear changed with updates that occured since this video was uploaded. 

I just wanted to point this out to see if the info on the wiki should be edited, or if there is info I am missing showing that the current info is indeed correct. [[User:Florsnake|Florsnake]] ([[User talk:Florsnake|talk]]) 21:06, 14 July 2022 (UTC)
:The info on the page is correct; I added a code reference for future questions. Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:22, 15 July 2022 (UTC)
::Hello, I believe you made a mistake with the odds. I also checked the code, and the line in question is "if (Game1.random.NextDouble() &lt; 0.001". Since NextDouble() generates a number between 0 and 1, shouldn't it be 0.001 * 100 = 0.1%? A 1/1000 chance would also make far more sense with most players observing ufos relatively frequently, not at all as infrequently as you would expect if the odds were really 0.001% or 1/10,000. The rain and 28th parts do seem to be correct. [[User:LordOfSpamAlot|LordOfSpamAlot]] ([[User talk:LordOfSpamAlot|talk]]) 09:59, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
:::Well, I went back through page history to March of 2017 (which was v1.2 of the game), and the number hasn't been changed on the page since at least then.
:::You're right about &lt;samp>num &lt; 0.001&lt;/samp> being 0.1%, not 0.001%. At the time it was added, 0.001% may have been correct, who knows? As it is now, the code is even more complex. It appears to me that the default animation is the UFO, and there is a 0.1% chance of the game deciding between the full moon and a sparkle animation. Which doesn't make sense to me. I'm going to have to do more research and probably step through the code to figure this out. For now, I'm going to remove the % chance.
:::(If anyone else wants to sort this out, please fell free!)
:::Thanks for bringing this up! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:37, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
:::Bit of an update: I found the original entry in page history, and it dates from 2016, from v1.07 of the game. It was provided with no code reference (which isn't surprising, given that most people hadn't decompiled the game code at that point). So, an update is definitely in order. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 22:15, 8 September 2022 (UTC)

Just had this Occur in my game. I concur that a bit of an update might be needed. &lt;!--I took a screenshot which can be found here: https://stardewvalleywiki.com/File:UFO_Spawn_28_Cabledragon.jpg .--> [[User:Cabledragon|Cabledragon]] ([[User talk:Cabledragon|talk]])
:I stepped through the code, and it seems that the date changes before the shipping screen summary is displayed. So, it can't occur on the night of the 27th of the season. On the night of the 28th, the game code says it's already the 1st of the next season. I'll adjust the page. (Also, I'm going to delete the screenshot.) Thank you for bringing this to our attention! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:11, 13 October 2022 (UTC)

== Lewis and Marnie ==

idk if im doing it right so here goes:

I have yet to test this(or even make it to fall), but apparently Lewis and Marnie sleep in the same bed one night of the year in fall, if this is true, should it be put on this page? [[User:S0ymiLk|S0ymiLk]] ([[User talk:S0ymiLk]]) 18:36, 14 September 2022
:It's not really a secret, it's in [[Lewis]]' schedule on his page already (Fall 9). [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 00:33, 15 September 2022 (UTC)
