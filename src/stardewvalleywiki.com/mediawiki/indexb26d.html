<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dangerous_Monsters">Dangerous Monsters</span></h2>
<p>Pages are all lacking speed info (except for Dangerous Squid Kid - thank you <a href="../User_Snakebeast.html" title="User:Snakebeast">Snakebeast</a> for updating that!).
</p><p>The relevant code is probably <samp>StardewValley.Monsters.Monster::BuffForAdditionalDifficulty</samp>.  In this function/method, damage, HP, and defense are buffed, but there is no equation to change speed.  So, it is likely that all dangerous monsters have the same speed as their normal counterparts, unless the monster has a specific entry in the data file <samp>Monsters.xnb</samp>.
</p><p>If no one else is interested in updating the pages (or no one sees this note), I can work on changing the pages (I'll put it on my "to do" list...)

<dl><dd>Some monsters have no weaker version (like the Blue Squid), and some have their own entry in <samp>Monsters.xnb</samp>, like the <a href="../Royal_Serpent.html" title="Royal Serpent">Royal Serpent</a>.  The Skeleton Mage has a weaker counterpart that is unimplemented, but the speed should be what is in the data file.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ladders_from_Rocks_Formula">Ladders from Rocks Formula</span></h2>
<p>I feel like the ladder drop chance from rocks could be expressed a lot more concisely as a formula rather than a paragraph, like the chance of treasure rooms in Skull Cavern. 
</p><p>Base chance: <code>0.02 + (2 x Daily Luck) + (Luck Buffs / 100) + (1 / # of Rocks Remaining)</code>
</p><p>Chance with no enemies: <code>0.06 + (2 x Daily Luck) + (Luck Buffs / 100) + (1 / # of Rocks Remaining)</code>
</p><p>As it is currently it feels clunky and hard to follow, plus it's inconsistent with the way other probabilities are presented. <a href="../User_Leninheads.html?title=User:Leninheads&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Leninheads (page does not exist)">Leninheads</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Leninheads.html?title=User_talk:Leninheads&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Leninheads (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 18:51, 20 July 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>That seems like a fine change; my only concerns are deleting the words pointing out that the Special Charm affects daily luck (although I'm not sure where 0.5% comes from, it seems like it should be 0.05 = 5%?) and the fact that food/drink buffs add 1% for every point of Luck. (The paragraph should say food/drink buffs or simply luck buffs, as you have in your equations.) Let's also not lose the part about a ladder spawn preventing another one from spawning by breaking a rock in the mines, and the whole bit about shafts in the Skull Cavern. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:47, 21 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>0.5% from special charm is correct, it should be 0.2 x daily luck, not 2, sorry about that. Would it make sense to add similar clarifications about what daily luck and luck buffs are to the treasure rooms section? <a href="../User_Leninheads.html?title=User:Leninheads&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Leninheads (page does not exist)">Leninheads</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Leninheads.html?title=User_talk:Leninheads&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Leninheads (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:09, 21 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>On the <a href="../Skull_Cavern.html" title="Skull Cavern">Skull Cavern</a> page? No, I don't think so, there are links to <a href="../Luck.html" title="Luck">Luck</a> and the "Buffs" section of Luck already on the page, that appear before the equations are presented to the reader. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:54, 22 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Agreed that it was clunky and hard to follow. I made some edits to the Ladders section for readability, does it read more clearly now? Personally, a math formula does not help me as a human understand conceptually how big of an impact each variable has; for example, glancing at (2 x Daily Luck) vs. (1 / # of Rocks Remaining), it's hard to tell which of those numbers is actually bigger -- it turns out that remaining rocks is MUCH more important than daily luck and that seems best explained in words. <a href="../User_Cooperka.html" title="User:Cooperka">Cooperka</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Cooperka.html" title="User talk:Cooperka">talk</a>) 01:47, 10 April 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Since of me playing in 2020 and people on YouTube, before v1.5 was introduced, some dungeon floors were infested floors, this also included floors 2-4, 42-44, and 82-44, 19, 59, and 99, 31-39, 71-79, and 111-119.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Difficulty_levels">Difficulty levels</span></h2>
<p>Should a note be added that the mines actually have 3 different difficulty levels? The added difficulty of the Shrine of Challenge and the Danger in the Deep quest are capable of stacking if you have the Shrine of Challenge active when you accept the Danger in the Deep quest. This allows the difficulty level to be 0 (neither active), 1 (1 xor the other active) or 2 (both active). While most checks just check if it is 0 or greater than 0, some actually use it as a number. Quickly checking through the code, I see that it increases the chance of finding radioactive ore, monsters spawning, slimes spawning as stacked slimes, leapers having partners, monsters in the mines to drop diamonds and prismatic shards; as well as buffing monsters (more damage, more health, more resilience). <a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 20:13, 7 May 2023 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bottom_of_the_mines_effects">Bottom of the mines effects</span></h2>
<p>While checking a few things, I decided to look up where the number of times the player has reached the bottom of the mines is used, to see if there are cumulative effects, and noticed some things are more controlled by reaching floor 40 or 80 instead, and some extra things not listed are changed. I'm not sure if it would be best to change the bottom of the mines section into a key floors section and add in notes about reaching floor 40 and floor 80 as well, or put floor 40 and floor 80 into a different section. This could also be a more general "progress", which also highlights elevators every 5 floors, and links to the adventurers guild page with a note saying weapons unlock as you go deeper.
</p><p>I found that <code>StardewValley.Utility::getStardewHeroCelebrationEventString</code> has <code>((Game1.player.timesReachedMineBottom &gt; 0)&#160;? " Dwarf 19 24 0"&#160;: "")</code>. However I don't think this is actually called anywhere in the game (other than debug).
</p><p>I also found that while technically it is checked in <code>StardewValley.Utility::getRandomItemFromSeason</code>, directly before this (combined with logical or) it checks if you have reached floor 40 (adding aquamarine, jade, diamond, frozen tear and purple mushrooms) or floor 80 (adding ruby, emerald and fire quartz). So I think that line from the bottom of the mines section is technically incorrect.
</p><p>In <code>StardewValley.Objects.BreakableContainer::releaseContents</code>, it changes what will drop from breakable containers. Only for those in MP (as it needs difficulty&gt;1) it replaces a chance to get sap (92) or basic retaining soil (370) with a frozen tear (84). For everyone, when the mines aren't difficult, depending on the container, it instead replaces sap or basic retaining soil with quartz (80) for container 118; frozen tear (84) for container 120; and for container 122 or 124 it changes one of the 3 possibilities for cave carrot (78) to fire quartz (82).
</p><p>In <code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::checkStoneForItems</code> for the gem node (44), it controls what gems may drop in a similar manner to <code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getRandomGemRichStoneForThisLevel</code> chooses which gem stone ore to use. If the player has reached the bottom, there is a 1 in 11 chance for jade, and a 2 in 11 chance for each of emerald, aquamarine, ruby, amethyst and topaz. If the player has not reached floor 40 there is a 50-50 chance of getting either amethyst or topaz. If they player has not yet reached floor 80, then there is a complex chance where the 2 in 11 chance for emerald and ruby are replaced by an equal chance of the other 4 gems, resulting in an 18.2% chance to get jade, and a 27.3% chance to get aquamarine, amethyst or topaz.
</p><p>While insignificant for normal gameplay, it does change the random seed for cutting down grass, and for the crystalRandom in <code>StardewValley.TerrainFeatures.Quartz::performToolAction</code>, and for the levelRandom in the apparently unused <code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::getCrystalColorForThisLevel</code>
</p><p>Other things affected by level include what weapons are unlocked in the adventurers guild; which monsters are to be slain for monster slayer quests; if a help wanted quest can request gold (level 40) and going above floor 25 means half the copper ore drops from regular geodes become iron ore, and above floor 75 half the iron ore drops from frozen geodes become gold ore. <a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 23:01, 7 May 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I would like to make a correction to the above. While <code>StardewValley.Locations.MineShaft::checkStoneForItems</code> does check what floor you have reached to reassign the gem node, that code is unreachable as before that it called <code>StardewValley.GameLocation::breakStone</code>, in which it replaces stone 44 with a randomly selected gem stone ore, including diamond. So if you have a gem node generate on level 1 of the mines the first time you enter the mines, it is possible for that to drop a diamond. This means it is only the gem stone ore which is affected, not the gem node. <a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 22:09, 8 May 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dangerous_Dungeon_floors">Dangerous Dungeon floors</span></h2>
<p>Just wanted to clarify the correction I made on the page.
In the chooseStoneType function, the first check is for radioactive ore including by checking if the mines are dangerous, which uses the mine level to determine it is at the mine.
Then it goes through different mine areas, determining which ore/rocks to populate there. Inside each of the normal areas (0,10,40 and 80), it has a check for if it is a dangerous level to change what is returned.
However to determine the mine area first checks if it is a "quarry level", which is what these dungeon floors are, and if so returns 77377.
There is no check for a dangerous floor for the the area 77377.
This means other than radioactive ore which is dealt with at the start; the rocks that appear on dungeon floors will be the same regardless of if the mines are dangerous.<a href="../User_JackBlack69.html?title=User:JackBlack69&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackBlack69 (page does not exist)">JackBlack69</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JackBlack69.html" title="User talk:JackBlack69">talk</a>) 22:08, 5 January 2024 (UTC)

(In fact, all special items within a given level range of the mines are equally likely, with the exception of levels 80-99 in which the Yeti Sword is twice as likely as other items).
