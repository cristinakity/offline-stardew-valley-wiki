==Heart Event for Pierre or for Gus?==

So there is an event that I'm unsure why I haven't seen anything around here about.  You come to Pierre's and there is a line of customers (sorry the specific ones escape my mind).  Pierre is offering a huge line of vegetables to Gus for 25,000G, and Gus tells him "I'd need to sell the saloon to get that much money, that's crazy!"  Anyway, I'm trying to figure out what that was all about?  A heart event, or what?

--[[User:MacCentris|MacCentris]] ([[User talk:MacCentris|talk]]) 17:14, 24 February 2021 (UTC)

:Are you sure that's not a mod? I've been playing this game for a pretty long time and I've never seen that. - [[User:PointlessSerpent|PointlessSerpent]] ([[User talk:PointlessSerpent|talk]]) 17:47, 24 February 2021 (UTC)

::I've also seen this heart event on a game file that's never been touched by mods. It's probably a newer event? Not sure where it would need to be situated on the wiki, though. [[User:RetroEdit|RetroEdit]] ([[User talk:RetroEdit|talk]]) 17:53, 24 February 2021 (UTC)
:::Ok. It could probably just go under the heart event section, but it could maybe go somewhere else depending on what it's triggered by. For now I think someone just needs to figure out what triggers it. - [[User:PointlessSerpent|PointlessSerpent]] ([[User talk:PointlessSerpent|talk]]) 19:29, 24 February 2021 (UTC)
:::: It's an event triggered by completing Pierre's Prime Produce on the orders board [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 20:40, 24 February 2021 (UTC)
::::: Looks like it's already on the wiki then. - [[User:PointlessSerpent|PointlessSerpent]] ([[User talk:PointlessSerpent|talk]]) 21:12, 24 February 2021 (UTC)

== Gold box on days where pierre is at ginger island? ==

1.5 spoilers ahead! so i’ve noticed that on days where pierre is at ginger island a box appears at the general store which sells his usual items, is it just for the community center repair or does it also work with joja? [[User:EnderAnson|EnderAnson]] ([[User talk:EnderAnson|talk]]) 21:34, 22 November 2021

(note: i also noticed the same for gus) [[User:EnderAnson|EnderAnson]] ([[User talk:EnderAnson|talk]]) 22:15, 22 November 2021
:I'm afraid I don't have a save file with both the Joja route and Ginger Island unlocked, but perhaps someone else has the answer. I would suspect it's the same in both cases, but good question! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 21:27, 23 November 2021 (UTC)

::I thought the Box for NPCs being on the Island was mentioned in the wiki already on shops' pages (it applies to Pierre but also Marnie and Robin, and you can't buy animals or farm buildings/upgrades on those days), but I can't find it, neither on the [[Ginger Island#Beach Resort]] page. It could be added.
::Regarding Joja, there is no &lt;samp>Morris_Beach.xnb&lt;/samp> file in the &lt;samp>Content\Characters&lt;/samp> folder, so maybe he never goes to the Beach? Unless he goes with his usual suit. There are neither Beach sprites for Evelyn, George, Gus, Jas, Kent, Linus, Vincent.

== Dislike ==

Hi! Not sure how to edit dislikes on here but I have found out that Pierre dislikes Dinosaur Eggs! [[User:Mimiishappy|Mimiishappy]] ([[User talk:Mimiishappy|talk]]) 21:22, 23 May 2022 (UTC)
:Dinosaur Eggs are considered Artifacts for purposes of gifting, not Eggs. Artifacts as a group are considered a Universal Dislike--all villagers dislike them with only a couple of exceptions. You will note that under Pierre's Dislikes, it says he dislikes all the Universal Dislikes except Fish (you can click through to see all the Universal Dislikes if you're not sure). Since Artifacts are not one of Pierre's exceptions to the Universal Dislikes, it means he dislike Artifacts, including Dinosaur Eggs. Hope that helps. [[User:Zendowolf|Zendowolf]] ([[User talk:Zendowolf|talk]]) 05:27, 24 May 2022 (UTC)

Ohhhh ok got it. Thank you so much!!!  [[User:Mimiishappy|Mimiishappy]] ([[User talk:Mimiishappy|talk]]) 00:28, 25 May 2022 (UTC)

== Unmentioned quote? ==

So the other day i was playing, during the fall. It was Abigail's birthday and i was heading to Pierre's to give her an amethyst, and when i walked behind the counter to talk to Pierre, he said something along the lines of "She'll really love that" Now that's got me wondering if other characters have a line similar. Like if you were going to give Maru or Sebastian a gift, and you were talking with the parents, or the same for Alex's grandparents. It was a really neat detail that stuck out to me, and i wanted to know if anyone else has seen it. I looked through the quotes listed on the article, but i didn't see it listed on here [[User:TheDude|TheDude]] ([[User talk:TheDude|talk]]) 01:15, 23 October 2022 (UTC)

: dunno if it's documented anywhere on the wiki, but, yeah, every character can tell you about the gift tastes of their friends and family. [[User:Atravita|Atravita]] ([[User talk:Atravita|talk]]) 16:14, 23 October 2022 (UTC)

::It's mentioned in the first paragraph of [[Friendship#Gifts]], that family and friends can give hints about what gifts an NPC likes. There is some debate about the "Friends" field in the infobox at the top right of every villager's page, some think it should list only people who will give gifting hints, but currently it lists more friends than that.
::Anyway, yes, if you click on Pierre to talk to him, he may randomly say "Abigail loves (item), you could really make her happy with that" or other variations. If he popped up a speech bubble when you aproached him, that would be new behavior I haven't heard of before! But it sounds like this was an unusually happy coincidence. I love it when the game does that! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:30, 23 October 2022 (UTC)

== Adding a new loved gift to Pierre's page ==

I recall interacting with Abigail and was told that Pierre loves "Price Catalogue" as a gift. I can only assume this is a new loved gift from the 1.6 update, but I'm not well-versed with using wikis so I don't wanna mess up the page for this. As much as I loathe Pierre, everyone deserves to know what he likes.
