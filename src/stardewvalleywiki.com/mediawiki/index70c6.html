'''Leo''' is a boy who initially lives on [[Ginger Island]].  His parents were lost at sea, and he considers the parrots who inhabit the island to be his family.  Initially, he is too shy to speak to the player, until the player "makes friends" with the parrots of the island by collecting 10 [[Golden Walnut]]s.

When the player reaches six hearts of friendship with Leo, he moves to the mainland of Stardew Valley, where he becomes friends with [[Linus]], [[Jas]] and [[Vincent]].

==Schedule==
===Fewer than 6 Hearts===
Leo lives on Ginger Island and doesn’t leave until the player has reached 6 hearts of friendship with him.

==Heart Events==
===Two Hearts===
{{Hearts|2}}

Enter [[Ginger Island#Island West|Island West]] on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.
{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
|The player is standing by the shore when Leo approaches from behind. He asks what the player is doing.
*{{Choice|Just enjoying the waves.|0}}
*{{Choice|Looking for fish.|0}}
*{{Choice|Thinking about someone special.|0}}
*{{Choice|Pondering the big questions.|0}}
Leo then asks what the player's home is like.

*{{Choice|There's a town full of people.|0}}
*{{Choice|There's forests, beaches, and mountains.|0}}
*{{Choice|It's like here, but colder.|0}}
*{{Choice|I live on a farm.|0}}
Leo thinks about your words for a bit before asking if there are any kids in Pelican Town
*{{Choice|Yes.|0}}
*{{Choice|What does that matter to a bird?|0}}
Regardless of the answer, Leo says he's aware he's not really a bird, and he tries to avoid thinking about it because it makes him feel lonely. He tries to fit in with the parrots, but knows he truly doesn't belong anywhere. He runs off before Willy enters the scene, wondering if there's any way to help him.
|}

===Three Hearts===
{{Hearts|3}}

After reaching three hearts with Leo, he sends the player a recipe in the mail.

===Four Hearts===
{{Hearts|4}}

Enter [[Ginger Island#Island North|Island North]] on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.
{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
|The player approaches Leo from behind. Leo squawks like a parrot and startles the player, which startles Leo in turn. Leo then apologizes and explains that he has difficulty communicating using words, then asks the player if they find him weird. Leo wonders about the differences in his life if he hadn't been washed ashore and wonders about what "normal kids" would have to say about him. Leo then asks the player if they think he could ever be a normal kid again. After the player answers, he states that he's happy he met the parrots regardless, and that he will always consider them family no matter what. Leo thanks the player for talking to him and says that the player may be a part of his family too, someday. He then teaches the player how to say "let's play" in parrot-talk.

Note that none of the dialogue options in this cutscene affect friendship with Leo.
|}

===Six Hearts===
{{Hearts|6}}

Enter [[Ginger Island#Island South|Island South]] on a sunny day between 6am and 6pm.
{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
|Linus invites Leo to move to the mainland of Stardew Valley.  Willy says that there are other children there, and Leo can visit Ginger Island anytime he wants to.  Willy asks the player what they think.  (Choices have no effect on friendship).

Leo decides to move to Stardew Valley.  That night, parrots build him a treehouse in the tree to the west of Linus' tent.
|}

===Seven Hearts===

Enter the Mountain on a non-rainy day between 6am and 7pm.
{|class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"
!style="text-align: left;" | '''Details&amp;nbsp;'''
|-
|Leo is shown adjusting well to life in Stardew Valley. He is seen cooking a bean hotpot with Linus on the campfire. In the next scene, he is at school at the library/museum with Penny, Vincent and Jas answering a question correctly. Another scene shows him fishing with Willy. The scene after has him watching Jas from the bushes in the playground, and running away when she notices. He arrives home at the treehouse and talks to his parrot friend about how good his day was, but he still misses Ginger Island.

==Trivia==
*Leo may still tell you it's nice to see you on the island again when you're both on the mainland, particularly when it's raining and his normal schedule dictates he would be on the island that day.
*In the player's initial dialogue with Leo, if asked how old he is, he responds "We don't think like that. We say... 'How many golden walnuts have you eaten?' ...I've eaten 3,729 golden walnuts."
**Despite the ambiguity of his age, Leo is classified within the game's code as a child.
*Despite not disclosing his age in human years, he knows his birthday (26 [[Summer]]) and reacts accordingly to birthday gifts.
*If you have missed Leo's four heart event, he gives you the option to view it by talking to him on the mainland.
