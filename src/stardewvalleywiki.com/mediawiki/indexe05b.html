==Format==
Each quest's key must be a unique positive integer. When adding a custom quest, prefixing the ID with your Nexus ID is recommended to help reduce mod conflicts.

The entry for each quest contains these slash-delimited quest fields:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Index
! Description
|-
| 0
| Type (''e.g.,'' &lt;samp>Location&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>Basic&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>LostItem&lt;/samp>, etc)
|-
| 1
| Title
|-
| 2
| Quest details/flavor text
|-
| 3
| Hint/condition
|-
| 4
| Solution/trigger
|-
| 5
| Next quest (-1 if none)
|-
| 6
| Gold (0 if none)
|-
| 7
| Reward description (Only if &lt;samp>Gold&lt;/samp> is not -1. Apparently unused?)
|-
| 8 
| Cancellable
|-
| 9
| (Optional) reaction text
|}

When using the ItemDelivery quest type, you can specify an item quantity after the item ID.

Ex: "5200": "ItemDelivery/Rock Candy/Abigail wants you to bring her several amethysts./Bring Abigail 10 amethysts./'''Abigail 66 10'''/-1/300/-1/true/Thanks, these look delicious!"

Here is the string in an easy to edit format:&lt;br />

ID(number): Type/Title/flavor text/Hint/Solution/Next quest (-1 if none)/Gold (0 if none)/Reward Description/Cancellable/Reaction Text(optional)
