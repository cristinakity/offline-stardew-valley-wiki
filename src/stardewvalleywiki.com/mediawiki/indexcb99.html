This page lists many of the '''Secrets''' discovered in ''[[Stardew Valley]]''.

==Recurring Easter Eggs==
There are a few Easter eggs that are recurring or interlinked in Stardew Valley.

===Hats===
[[Hats]] can be placed on...

* [[Children]] (of toddler age), [[Animals#Horse|horses]], [[Animals#Pets|cats, and dogs]]. They can be removed by holding another hat and clicking on them again; that will pop off the old hat, but won't place the new hat unless you do it again.
* [[Scarecrow#Rarecrows|Rarecrow 3 (Alien)]]. They can then be swapped with another hat, but can only be fully removed by breaking the rarecrow which drops both items.
* [[Sea Urchin|Sea urchins]] in [[Fish Tank|fish tanks]] by holding the hat and clicking the fish tank. They can be removed by opening the fish tank inventory and taking the hat.

===Lucky Purple Shorts===
[[File:Springobjects789.png|thumb|right|Lucky Purple Shorts]]
[[File:Springobjects071.png|thumb|right|Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts]]
[[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]]' [[Quests#Mayor's &amp;ldquo;Shorts&amp;rdquo;|lucky purple shorts]] have a number of secrets.
* Putting them in the [[Luau]] soup gets a unique response from the [[Governor]] and [[Lewis]].
* Putting them in the [[Stardew Valley Fair]] grange display disqualifies the player, and [[Lewis]] gives the player {{price|750|token}} star tokens as a bribe to keep his secret. [[Marnie]] also gives unique dialogue at the Fair after seeing the shorts in the display.
* [[Tailoring]] them with a [[Gold Bar|gold bar]] produces Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts. These are equivalent to the Lucky Purple Shorts for completing the quest or triggering some of the other secrets, but it can also be worn by the player for an amusing reaction from [[Marnie]] and [[Lewis]].
* Giving Lewis Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts to complete the "Mayor's Shorts" quest while he is visiting [[Ginger Island]] will cause him to wear them as beach attire any time he visits the island again for the next 28 days. This cannot be done with normal Lucky Purple Shorts.
* '''REMOVED:''' Before version 1.6, Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts could also be acquired by placing a [[staircase]] into the player's pants slot.
* Attempting to gift them to [[Marnie]] gives unique dialogue.
* Placing a staircase in [[Lewis]]' bedroom gives access to a secret maze room with these shorts at the end. Attempting to pick up the shorts will spawn a cursed Lucky Purple Shorts that slowly attacks the player and is immune to attacks. This process is repeatable to obtain multiple shorts.
* Putting them in the [[tackle]] slot of a fishing rod changes the [[Fish Shop#Bobber Machine|bobber style]] to a unique Lucky Purple Shorts bobber. This cannot be done with Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts.
* Lucky Purple Shorts can be placed into [[Fish Tank]]s as a decoration item. This cannot be done with Trimmed Lucky Purple Shorts.

===Dove Children===
[[Children#Dismissing Children|Turning children into doves]] unlocks several Easter eggs.

* You may receive a mysterious [[telephone]] call: "''You place the receiver to your ear, and are met with a roiling, abrasive static. But wait... beneath it all, you can make out something else... an otherworldly voice... 'Y-O-U H-A-V-E F-O-R-S-A-K-E-N U-S'''". This no longer happens once you unlock the cursed doll spawn below.

* Watching TV on Fall 26 (the day before [[Spirit's Eve]]) and choosing "???" will show an [[Ancient Doll]] on the TV screen with an eerie message ("''You've brought this upon yourself... now I'm free... Hee hee hee!''"), and an [[Ancient Doll]] will pop out of the TV. Thereafter, a cursed Ancient Doll will fly around and attack players in front of the [[Dark Shrine of Selfishness]]. When slain, it will turn into a large black bird and fly away. Exiting and re-entering the Witch's Hut will respawn the doll. Killing this doll counts toward the [[Adventurer's Guild#Monster Eradication Goals|Monster Eradication goal]] of killing 200 bats, and awards 20 [[Combat]] XP.

* On the [[Farm Maps|Four-Corners Farm]], players may catch an Ancient Doll once while fishing.

* If you've turned multiple children into doves, there's a 15% chance they'll fly past in formation at [[the Summit]].

===Bad at Music===
In [[multiplayer]] mode, if a player's randomized unique multiplayer ID (only editable in the [[Saves|save file]]) is divisible by 111, music they produce will sound off:
* The [[Multiplayer/Emotes|music emote]] will produce a random off-tune strum instead of one of the normal melodies.
* The piano in [[Elliott's Cabin]] will play off-key tones (F4, C5, D5, G#5) instead of the usual ones (B4, D#5, E5, F#5), and the [[#Elliott's Piano|other piano Easter egg]] won't trigger.

==Intro Screens==
[[File:ConcernedApeNoGlasses.png|thumb|right|200px|The ConcernedApe logo after clicking it.]]
[[File:ConcernedApeRareOccurence.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Rare green animation.]]
===Logo===
Clicking on the [[ConcernedApe]] logo during the loading screen will cause the sunglasses (if present) to disappear and the eyes to open. A duck/splat sound will also be heard.

A rare green version of the ConcernedApe logo can occur when clicking on the logo on the loading screen.

===Tip Messages===
The game keeps track of how many times you launch it, and shows friendly messages in the bottom-left corner of the ConcernedApe logo screen based on that number.

===Title Screen===
[[File:Title Screen Secrets Composite.png|thumb|right|200px|Title Screen Secrets]]
''Note that these do not work in Chinese.''
* Clicking the letter "E" in the game name ten times will show an alien open a door behind the letter. It will smile and wave for two seconds before it fades away. This easter egg is not possible on the Nintendo Switch version.
* Clicking the leaves ten times will cause three Junimos to appear in the logo and wave.
* Clicking the lower right screw on the letter "W" ten times will cause several butterflies to appear.
* Clicking the bottom-left corner of the title box a few times will pick up a little happy face. You can click the hole in the R to place it, which will cause foliage to appear around the title box and parrots to fly out of it.
* If you use a controller, pressing B on Xbox or O on PS4 will cause the clouds around you to move at a rapid pace. Only works where the two birds are flying, and stops upon the menu coming down.

==Character Creation==
===Special Characters===
{{#lst:The Player|specialkeys}}

===Item Spawn Cheat===
'''PC/Mobile Only:''' Naming your character using an internal [[Modding:Items|object ID number]] in brackets will give you the item that corresponds with the number whenever an NPC mentions you by your name. For example, entering [645][499][163] will give you an [[Iridium Sprinkler]], [[Ancient Seeds]], and a [[Legend]]. (This exploit also works with naming children and animals.)

'''Mobile Only:''' Naming a character with an invalid [[Modding:Items|object item id]] (such as [26]) will generate an [[Error Item]].

===Favorite Thing===
Entering "ConcernedApe" as the favorite thing when creating a character results in some additional text when consuming a [[Stardrop]].

[[File:ConcernedApe Favourite.png|400px]]

Entering anything containing "Stardew" as the favorite thing when creating a character results in the additional text "You feel an unwavering connection to the valley itself." appearing when consuming a [[Stardrop]].  Note that the "S" in "Stardew" must be capitalized.

[[File:StardewFavorite.png|400px]]

==In-Game Menus==
===Shipping Screen===
A few rare animations can be seen in the background of the Shipping screen at the end of the day depending on certain conditions.&lt;ref name="shippingscreen" />
*Numbers over 999,999 will overflow on the blank space and will move up and down in a wave pattern.
* On the 24th of Winter, [[wikipedia:Santa Claus|Santa Claus]] can be seen with a few reindeer crossing the top of the screen in his sleigh. [[File:SantaFlying.gif|right]]
[[File:Winter24th.png|400px]]
* If it is not the 27th and it did not rain, there is a small chance of a UFO crossing the top of the screen. 
* Idling on the screen for long enough will cause it to appear more often.&lt;ref name="ufo" /> [[File:UFO animated.gif|right]]
[[File:UFO.png|400px]]
* If it is not the 27th and it did not rain, there is a small chance of a full moon appearing at the top right of the screen. Clicking it 11 times will cause the man in the moon to reveal himself. [[File:MoonMan.gif|right]]
[[File:Mr.Moon-Reduced.png|400px]]
* On the night of [[Weather#Green_Rain|green rain]], the Shipping screen displays a sky with green fog and dark gray storm clouds.
[[File:Green Rain Screenshot.png|400x300px|frameless]]

===Lonely Stone===
[[File:EasterEggLonelyStone.png|thumb|right|200px|The lonely stone on the Stardew Valley map.]]
The lonely stone is not an area, but it has a location on the Stardew Valley map. Upon clicking the lonely stone on the map, a rock sound effect will play.

The lonely stone also hasn't been mentioned by any villagers/characters nor is there any lore about it mentioned by ConcernedApe or hidden in the game's files.

===Gift Log===
When you have at least four hearts of [[friendship]] with a character, clicking their sprite in the gift log (accessed from the social tab by clicking their entry) will play a sound and show a special animation (different for each character) for a few seconds.

===Skills Screen===
[[File:CCJunimoEasterEgg.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Community Center Square with Leaves]]
Clicking the Junimo in the lower left corner multiple times makes plants appear in the corners of the square.
{{Clear}}

==Secret Items==
===Locked Boxes===
[[File:Incomprehensible Lost Book.png|thumb|right|200px|"Incomprehensible" [[Lost Books|Lost Book]]]]

The first letters in the [[Museum]]'s incomprehensible [[Lost Books|Lost Book]] form these words:
:''SUPER CUCUMBER TOWN''
:''DUCK MAYO SALOON''
:''STRANGE BUN TOY BOX''

Three secret statues can be found by placing items in locked boxes around the valley per these instructions:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Image
!Name
!Requirement
|-
|[[File:??HMTGF??.png|32px|link=]]
|[[??HMTGF??]]
|Place a [[Super Cucumber]] in the brown box located in the fenced area north of the [[Blacksmith]].
|-
|[[File:??Pinky Lemon??.png|32px|link=]]
|class="no-wrap"|[[??Pinky Lemon??]]
|Place a [[Duck Mayonnaise]] in the partly hidden metal box in the back room of [[the Stardrop Saloon]].
|-
|[[File:??Foroguemon??.png|32px|link=]]
|[[??Foroguemon??]]
|Place a [[Strange Bun]] in the chest in [[Vincent]]'s room at [[1 Willow Lane]].
|}

The box behind [[JojaMart]] (to the northeast) doesn't do anything.

===Galaxy Sword===
[[File:Galaxy Sword.png|right|36px|link=]]
After finding and donating all four [[Artifacts|Dwarf Scroll]]s to the [[Museum]], the player receives the [[Dwarvish Translation Guide]]. If the player proceeds to the Graveyard, one of the previously unreadable tombstones can now be read.

{{Quote|You translate the dwarvish:&lt;br />&lt;br />Stand between the pillars three&lt;br />With gift as precious as the sky:&lt;br />A rainbow forged from land, not sea&lt;br />Then galaxies will heed your cry}}

This points the player towards [[the Desert]] and the set of [[The Desert#Three Pillars|three pillars]] to the Northeast. Stepping into the center of the pillars while holding a [[Prismatic Shard]] will cause the shard to be transformed into the [[Galaxy Sword]]. (Note that finding the Dwarf Scrolls is not needed to obtain the Galaxy Sword.)

===Junimo Plush===
[[File:Junimo Plush.png|right|48px|link=]]
The [[Junimo Plush]] is a unique piece of [[furniture]]. It can be found by shaking a bush in the northwest corner of Pelican Town on the 28th of any season at exactly 12:00pm.
[[File:Junimo plush.jpg|thumb|left|Location of the plush]]
{{Clear}}

===Strange Capsule===
After a [[Random Events#Strange Capsule|Strange Capsule]] appears and breaks open, there's a 1% chance of glimpsing a dark creature wave after dark at the [[Bus Stop]], or run behind trees and bushes in [[Pelican Town]] (Near the tree south of [[1 Willow Lane]], in the bush below [[2 Willow Lane]], and in the bushes next to the bridge leading to [[the Beach]]).

|-
|}&lt;section end="fishingsecrets" />

===Meowmere===
If the player throws an [[Ancient Doll]] into the lava pool in floor 100 of [[the Mines]], or in the lava next to the chest at the [[Forge]] on [[Ginger Island]], a bone serpent from Terraria will rise from the pool and give them the [[Far Away Stone]]. Placing this item on the plant pedestal found in the basement of [[Wizard's Tower]] will open up a portal, where a cat steps in and gives the player the [[Meowmere]] weapon.

==World==
===Skull Cavern Plaques===
The plaques that can occasionally be found on the walls of the [[Skull Cavern]] have been found to contain text encoded by a cipher.&lt;ref name="cipher" />

The plaques that are found on the rough walled levels have been deciphered to give the following.
{{Quote|we are&lt;br />cursed&lt;br />too much&lt;br />iridium}}
This may be a reference to the [[Slimes|Purple Slimes]] that can drop [[Iridium Ore]] that are frequently found in large numbers at these levels.

The plaques on the walls of the levels inhabited by [[Mummy|Mummies]] has been deciphered to give the following:
{{Quote|wizard&lt;br />sealed us&lt;br />in this&lt;br />prison&lt;br />until the&lt;br />day a hero&lt;br />puts us to&lt;br />rest}}
This may or may not refer to the [[Wizard]] who lives in [[Cindersap Forest]].

===Volcano Plaque===
The plaque above the [[Forge]] has been translated &lt;ref name="volcanoplaque" /> to say:
{{Quote|ait otusnats tomu htam doo smol din mopu o uy hamu duuonh snau}}
which is Dwarvish for:
{{Quote|our ancestors came from the sky but made a new home beneath stone}}

===Old Master Cannoli===
A [[Stardrop]] can be obtained from [[Old Master Cannoli]] in the [[Secret Woods]], in exchange for a [[Sweet Gem Berry]].

===Rare Dialogue===

When choosing "Supplies Shop" in [[Marnie's Ranch]], the text under [[Marnie]]'s portrait normally reads "Animal supplies for sale!" But there is a 0.01% chance for the text to read {{Quote|*sigh*... When the door opened I thought it might be [[Lewis]].}}
When entering [[Robin]]'s or [[Marnie]]'s shop, there is a chance for a dialogue bubble to pop up with them saying {{Quote|Lew...? Oh...}}
When entering [[Pierre]]'s shop, there is a chance for a dialogue bubble to pop up with him saying {{Quote|Did you remember your wallet?}}
When entering [[the Stardrop Saloon]], there is a chance for a dialogue bubble to pop up with [[Gus]] saying {{Quote|You look like you need a drink.}}
When entering the [[Museum]], there is a chance for a dialogue bubble to pop up with [[Gunther]] saying {{Quote|You smell like dirt... good!}}

===Elliott's Piano===
There are two secrets with the piano in In [[Elliott's Cabin]]:

* When [[Elliott]] is working at his desk, playing the first eight notes of the Stardew Valley Overture on the piano will make Elliott turn towards the player with a heart emote. (This doesn't affect his friendship with the player.) If you label the piano keys 1&amp;ndash;4 from left to right, the tune can be played with these notes at any speed: 2432 3421.
* See also the [[#Bad at Music|bad at music]] secret.

===Beach Creature===
Very rarely, a [[The Merpeople|green creature]] may appear south of the main docks at [[The Beach|the beach]]. There's no way to interact with the creature; after a short while, it'll swim south and disappear off-screen.

There's a roughly 0.06% chance per second (0.001% per game tick) that the creature will try spawning in a random tile near the docks (see spawn area below). The creature will only spawn if that random tile is open water, and there's a vertical line of open water between that tile and the bottom of the map, which significantly reduces the likelihood. There's no limit to the number of creatures that may spawn, but more than one creature at once is extraordinarily rare. 

The same creature can be seen in [[Krobus]]' 14 heart event, in which it carries the shadow person on its tentacles (note that in this event, the creature is not a random occurrence like the one found during regular gameplay).

&lt;gallery>
File:Mereperson.png|The creature in-game.
File:Sea Monster Anim.gif|The creature's animation.
File:Merpeople spawn area.png|The creature's spawn area.
&lt;/gallery>

===Slimes===
* Slimes can be hatched in odd places using a [[Slime Incubator]], including [[Pelican Town]] or the [[Railroad]]. Slimes hatched in the town are known to interact with the townsfolk, including greeting them by name and having the townsfolk greet them back. Note that this doesn't work in all locations, in some places slimes will be removed overnight.
* Slimes can also be hatched inside the [[Farmhouse]]. If you are married, your spouse may react to the slime with various funny dialogue while trying to kill it.

===Random events===
See [[Random Events]].

===Shrine of Illusions===
Using [[the Shrine of Illusions]] to add [[The Player#Exploits|item spawn codes]] to your character name will randomly show one of these chat messages:

* ''ConcernedApe: What kind of a name is that? Seems fishy...''
* ''Mr. Qi: Easy &lt;nowiki>{{item name}}&lt;/nowiki>, huh? I'm disappointed, kid. I thought you wanted to beat this game fair and square?''
* ''*Grandpa is shaking his head... 'I built this farm the old fashioned way, not with unlimited &lt;nowiki>{{item name}}&lt;/nowiki>...'''
* ''ConcernedApe is mad that you're cheating...''&lt;br />''ConcernedApe: I'm not actually mad... have fun.''
* ''Calling all cars! Calling all cars! We've got [a/an] &lt;nowiki>{{item name}}&lt;/nowiki> thief on the loose!''

===Summit===
*Achieving perfection in [[Mr. Qi]]'s walnut room unlocks access to [[the Summit]]. When you visit it, there's a chance you'll see something fly past in the distance:
:* 25% chance of a seasonal bird;
:* else if you've turned multiple children into doves, there's a 15% chance they'll fly past in formation;
:* else if you've seen [[Harvey#Eight Hearts|Harvey's 8-heart event]], there's a 10% chance a jet flies past;
:* else if you've seen [[Maru#Ten Hearts|Maru's 10-heart event]], there's a 5% chance that MarILDA will fly past.
*Santa Claus may show up on Winter 25th.
*Attempting to access the Summit before achieving [[perfection]] triggers a cutscene in which [[Mr. Qi]] scolds the player and pushes them off the Summit.

==Chat==
* Entering &lt;samp>/cheat&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/cheats&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/imacheat&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/money&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/showmethemoney&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/freegold&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/debug&lt;/samp>, or &lt;samp>/rosebud&lt;/samp> shows a message from [[ConcernedApe]]: "''ConcernedApe: Nice try...''"
* Entering &lt;samp>/ca&lt;/samp>, &lt;samp>/ape&lt;/samp>, or &lt;samp>/concernedape&lt;/samp> shows a message from ConcernedApe. This message is shown the first time: "''Hello. I hope you're enjoying your new life here. Take care!''" Doing it again results in this message: "''ConcernedApe is hard at work...''"
* Entering &lt;samp>/qi&lt;/samp> shows a message from [[Mr. Qi]]. The first time it says: "''Mr. Qi: Hey, kid. Yeah, I'm here. What'd you expect?''" The second time, this message is shown: "''Mr. Qi: Hey... keep up the good work, and never stop striving for success!  I'll see you soon, kid...''" Thereafter you'll receive the message: "''Mr. Qi is away''".

==Trivia==
In the first [https://youtu.be/4Ab6EY9PKmc?t=13942 Stardew Valley Cup] live event, [[ConcernedApe]] said that there's one secret that he didn't think anyone ever found. He said that:

''"I guess you might say a message or something. And actually the thing is the message is not even really relevant anymore. It was like originally revealing something that's like actually not even true anymore. But it's still I don't think anyone has found it, and I don't know if anyone ever will. Because it's extremely obscure to find it."''
