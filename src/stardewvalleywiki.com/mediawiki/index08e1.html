We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from a Child. If you are a Child, do not submit any Personal Data to us. If you become aware that a Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at concernedape@stardewvalley.net or 701 N. 36th St., Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98103, so we may delete that Personal Data.

'''''5. For what purposes do we collect your Personal Data?'''''

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|style="padding: 12px;"|We may collect your Personal Data for the below purposes.

:*''To provide or improve the Services'': We may use your Personal Data to process your requests to access the Services and certain of their features and to generally present and improve the Services. For example, when you create a profile on the Forum, we may use your Personal Data to present the Forum to you and to notify you about activity on the Forum. By way of another example, when you purchase a product from the Shop, we may use your Personal Data to charge and ship the product to you.

:*''To administer the Services'': We may use your Personal Data for any lawful business or operational purpose in connection with administering the Services. For example, if you reach out to us, we may use your Personal Data to respond to you or to troubleshoot a problem you reported having with the Services.

:*''To market the Services'': We may use your Personal Data to market the Services to you. For example, with your prior consent, we may send you news and updates about our products and the Services via email.

:*''In furtherance of legal and safety objectives'': We may access, use, and share with others your Personal Data for purposes of safety and other matters in the public interest. We may also provide access to your Personal Data to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings (e.g., in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal processes). We may also provide access to your Personal Data to protect our rights and property and those of our agents, users, and others, including to enforce our agreements, policies, and our Terms of Use. For example, if you post to the Forum, we may monitor and store those communications to detect cheating, fraud, illegal activity, or other activities that may violate our Terms of Use.

:*''In connection with a sale or other transfer of our business'': In the event all or some of our assets are sold, assigned, or transferred to or acquired by another company due to a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, financing, bankruptcy, or otherwise, your Personal Data may be among the transferred assets.

:*''As we may describe to you when collecting your Personal Data'': There may be other situations when we collect your Personal Data and simultaneously describe the purpose for that collection.

&lt;u>Lawful Basis&lt;/u>

We only collect, use, or store your Personal Data for a lawful basis such as:

:*you voluntarily provide it to us with your specific, informed, and unambiguous consent (for example, when you sign up for our newsletter);
:*it is necessary to provide you with a Service that you have requested (for example, providing you access to the Forum or shipping a purchased product from the Shop to you);
:*we have a legitimate business interest that is not outweighed by your privacy rights (for example, to respond to your inquiries); or 
:*it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of others (for example, where necessary to protect the safety of one of our users or someone else).
|-
|}


'''''6.	In what situations do we disclose your Personal Data?'''''

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|style="padding: 12px;"|We may disclose your Personal Data to a third party, such as a service provider or contractor for a business or operational purpose, or with your consent. When we disclose Personal Data for a business or operational purpose, we enter into a contract with the service provider or contractor that describes the purpose and requires the service provider or contractor to both keep that Personal Data confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract. These service providers and contractors include our:
:*e-commerce service providers;
:*moderation service providers; and
:*data analytic service providers.

We may also disclose your Personal Data:

:*to our subsidiaries and affiliates;
:*to our lawyers, consultants, accountants, business advisors, and similar third parties who owe us duties of confidentiality;
:*to a buyer or other successor in the event of a sale, merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Data retained by us pertaining to the users of the Services is among the assets transferred;
:*to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, such as responding to a government or regulatory request;
:*to enforce any contract we may have in effect with you;
:*if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others; and
:*if you have consented to such a disclosure.

We do &lt;u>'''''not'''''&lt;/u> sell, rent, or share your Personal Data for cross contextual behavioral or targeted advertising, automated decision-making, or profiling purposes.
|-
|}


'''''7. How is my Personal Data protected?'''''

{|class="wikitable"
|-
|style="padding: 12px;"|&lt;u>Our Retention, Purpose Limitation, and Security Policies&lt;/u>

We protect your Personal Data through a combination of collection, security, and retention policies.

:*''Limited retention'': We retain each category of Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Data was provided to us or, if longer, to comply with any legal obligations, to resolve disputes, and to enforce contracts. For example, we may retain Personal Data collected about you to prevent repeated violations or suspected violations of our Terms of Use if your profile has been banned or your access to the Services has been disabled for any reason. To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the Personal Data, the purposes for which we process the Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. For example, subject to the foregoing considerations, it is our policy to delete your Personal Data if we stop operating our Game or the feature through which the Personal Data was acquired.

:*''Purpose limitation'': We will use your Personal Data only for the Services you choose to access and for the purposes notified to you, unless we otherwise obtain your consent. We limit the collection of Personal Data to what is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary for those purposes.

:*''Security measures'': We use reasonable security measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the volume and nature of Personal Data processed and risk involved, considering the size, scope, and type of our business, and have implemented contractual, technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. For example, we use a secure server. All supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted. Such information is only accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems and that are required to keep the information confidential, subject to any additional requirements imposed by our contract with them and applicable law. As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Data. In the event of a security breach, we will notify the proper regulatory authorities and any affected users of the breach within 72 hours after we become aware of the breach to the extent required by applicable law.

&lt;u>Your Practices and Activities&lt;/u>

Your practices and activities are likewise very important for the protection of your Personal Data. You should take certain steps to help protect your Personal Data, such as being mindful of what you share publicly on the Services, including the below.

:*Do not use your real name when selecting a username.

:*Do not post your real name or anything private about yourself or anyone else in public-facing areas of the Services.

:*Do not pick a password that is easy to guess, and do not share your password.

Please remember that we have no control over what other users do with the content of your communications and no responsibility or obligation regarding other users.

:*deny you the Services;
:*charge you different prices or rates for the Services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;

:*suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for the Services or a different level or quality of the Services.

&lt;u>Verifiable Consumer Requests&lt;/u>

To exercise your rights described above, please email us at concernedape@stardewvalley.net with the subject line “State Privacy Rights” or mail your request to 701 N. 36th St., Suite 200, Seattle, WA 98103. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Data. The verifiable consumer request must:

:*provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Data or an authorized representative; and
:*describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Data relates to you. We will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

&lt;u>Response Timing and Format&lt;/u>

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response to that profile. If you do not have a profile with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request, unless you request a longer period of time for Personal Data we collected about you after January 1, 2022. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

To appeal a decision regarding your verifiable consumer request, please submit your appeal using one of the two methods above. Your appeal should include an explanation of the reason you disagree with our decision. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Data that is readily useable, easy-to-understand, and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
