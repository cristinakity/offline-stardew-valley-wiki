[[File:StardewValleyFair.png|500px|right]]
The '''Stardew Valley Fair''' is a [[Festivals|festival]] that takes place on Tuesday, the 16th of [[Fall]] every year. The player attends the fair by entering [[Pelican Town]] between 9am and 3pm.  When the player leaves the festival, they will be returned to [[The Farm]] at 10pm.

On the day of the Festival, the player cannot enter Pelican Town until 9am. Every home and shop outside the town square is "locked" and cannot be entered before or during the festival.

There are several games where the player can earn [[File:Token.png|24px|link=]]Star Tokens, a currency that can be exchanged for prizes at the Shop near the entrance to the [[Bus Stop]]. The maximum number of tokens that can be held is 9,999.

The purchase limit on each of the available fixed stock items is 1 (until next year when they replenish). Therefore, the maximum number of Star Tokens that may be used for the fixed stock is 4,900 (2,900 if they have already purchased the [[Stardrop]]). The Shop will be fully stocked again the following year, with the exception of the [[Stardrop]] which may be purchased only once. Star tokens do not carry over from the previous year, but the grange event can be repeated to earn more star points.

The Fair also has a Grange Display contest where products of the farm can be shown to gain Star Tokens. Talk to [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]] when ready to have the products judged.
All of the Grange Display items can be picked up after judging, but they will '''not''' be automatically returned to the inventory. If the player leaves the items behind in the Grange Display, as of {{version|1.5|version 1.5}}, they can retrieve them later in the [[Mayor's Manor|Lost and Found]].

North of the fair by the fountains, [[Gus]] can be found cooking [[Survival Burger]]s, which the player can eat to refill their energy bar, but this won't be noticeable until exiting the festival.

The festival ends when the player leaves Pelican Town.

|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Fishing Minigame.png|150px]]
|Fishing Minigame
|data-sort-value="50"|{{Price|50}}
|Play the Fishing Minigame to catch fish. Each caught fish gives between 12 and 25 points. Any non-fish item caught gives 1 point. Bonus points are earned for perfect catches. It is possible to make over 600 Star Tokens per {{Price|50}} spent. Can be played as many times as the player has money for.
|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Slingshot Minigame.png|150px]]
|Slingshot Minigame
|data-sort-value="50"|{{Price|50}}
|Shoot the targets with the Slingshot. Each target gives different points — red targets give 1 point, blue targets give 2 points, and purple targets give 5 points. At the end, the player gets a point multiplier based on their accuracy. An accuracy of 100% provides a 4x multiplier. It is possible to win 500 Star Tokens per {{Price|50}} spent. Can be played as many times as the player has money for.
|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Smashing Stone.png|150px|center]]
|Smashing Stone
|data-sort-value="0"|Free
|At the Smashing Stone the player can test their strength by clicking the stone at the right moment when the bar hits the top or bottom. One Star Token is earned for hitting the top or bottom.
|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Token Seller.png|150px|center]]
|Token Seller
|data-sort-value="50"|{{Price|50}} per [[File:Token.png|24px|link=]]Token
|At the Star Token Seller, Star Tokens can be purchased for {{Price|50}} each. This is the least cost effective way to earn tokens, but time-wise, it is the quickest way.
|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Clairvoyant Booth.png|150px|center]]
|Fortune Teller Booth
|data-sort-value="100"|{{Price|100}}
|Each year at the Fortune Teller Booth, [[Television#Fortune Teller|Welwick]] the Fortune Teller will tell the player events from the future for {{Price|100}}. She will tell the player something about whichever two villagers are at the top of their [[Friendship|Social]] menu, as well as something about whichever [[Skills|skill]] the player has the highest level in. If the player has already paid to have their fortune read that year, she will say "I've already read your fortune... go away."
|-
|[[File:Stardew Valley Fair Spinning Wheel.png|150px|center]]
|Spinning Wheel
|Varies
|At the Spinning Wheel, the player can bet Star Tokens on whether the spinner will land on green or orange.

When the spinner falls below a certain speed, if it would cause the spinner to land on the losing colour, there is a chance for it to set its speed to a higher speed, proportional to the player's [[Luck#Luck_Buff|Luck]]. This chance is equal to &lt;samp>Luck / 15&lt;/samp> if the player chose Green, or &lt;samp>Luck / 20&lt;/samp> if the player chose Orange.&lt;ref name="spinnerLuck"/> As the player cannot eat or drink in the festival (other than Gus's [[Survival Burger|Survival Burgers]]), the player would need to use any Luck-improving consumables before entering the festival in order to maximize the chance of winning.

With no Luck modifiers, the Wheel is ~3.3 times more likely to land on Green than Orange.&lt;ref Name="initialVelocity"/> By taking advantage of this, players can quickly earn the star tokens required to purchase all items in the shop. For maximum expected profit while protecting against losses, the player should always bet 53% of their current stars on Green.&lt;ref Name="OptimalBet"/>
|}

==Grange Display==
To participate in the showcase, '''bring up to 9 items''' to put in the grange display which best showcase the player's abilities. The display will be judged on the quality and diversity of the items, and is rewarded with star tokens based on the place achieved. Items can be retrieved after the judging is completed.

In a multiplayer game, there is a single display for the farm that is '''shared by all players'''. Only one player may interact with the display at a time - if a player is putting or removing items from the display, no other players may interact with the display. Once the host is satisfied with the display, they can initiate the judging by talking to Mayor Lewis. Lewis will score the display, and all players will receive the same placement. Once the judging is complete, each player '''must separately talk to Mayor Lewis''' to receive the Star Tokens.

'''Games can still be played at the fair after the grange display is judged.'''

===Scoring===
The points are calculated as follows:&lt;ref name="grangepts" />

====Base Points====
14 points are awarded automatically.

====Number of Items====
Points based on how many items are submitted, according to the formula: 2x-9 (Where ''x'' is the number of items on display).

{|class="wikitable"
!Number of items
!Points awarded
|-
| 9 || 9
|-
| 8 || 7
|-
| 7 || 5
|-
| 6 || 3
|-
| 5 || 1
|-
| 4 || -1
|-
| 3 || -3
|-
| 2 || -5
|-
| 1 || -7
|-
| 0 || -9
|}
It is always better to try and fill all nine spots, even if the items submitted are uncategorized (trash), since leaving any spot empty will lessen the overall score.

====Categories====
There are eight categories of items recognized by the Fair: '''Animal Products''', '''Artisan Goods''', '''Cooking''', '''Fish''', '''Foraging''' (including '''Flowers''' and '''Tree Saps'''), '''Fruits''', '''Minerals''', and '''Vegetables'''. Each category represented in the display earns 5 points, up to a maximum of 30 points. This means only six of these categories need to be filled to maximize the score.

Below are the items that the Fair will recognize in each category. Any items which do not fall into any of these categories will not earn the additional 5 points, but will earn points based on the [[#Sell Price &amp;amp; Quality|sell price and quality]], explained in the next section.

====Sell Price &amp;amp; Quality====
A number of points for each item are awarded based on its sell price and quality, with a maximum of 8 points per item. The sell price used in-game is the actual sell price, not the base sell price. For example, a gold-quality item with a base sell price of {{price|200}} would earn points for having an actual sell price of {{price|300}} '''and''' for being gold quality.

[[File:GrangeDisplay123Points.png|thumb|right|120px|One possible 124 point display]]
Assuming that nine items, each worth 8 points, are submitted and that the items represent at least six unique categories, the highest score obtainable is {{#expr: (14 + 8*9 + 9-2*0 + 5*6) }} (14 + 72 + 9 + 30). Getting the maximum score of 125 is only possible if one has access to [[Deluxe Fertilizer]]. Out of the eight categories that exist, six contain 8-point items: Animal Products, Artisan Goods, Fish, Foraging, Fruits, and Vegetables. 8 point Vegetable items are only obtainable with Deluxe Fertilizer. Without deluxe fertilizer to grow iridium quality crops, the next best vegetable item is the iridium-quality [[Fiddlehead Fern]], at 7 points. Because of this, the highest score obtainable without access to Deluxe Fertilizer is 124.

Assuming that nine items are submitted representing at least 6 categories, winning with a minimum of 90 points requires submitting eight 4-point items and one 5-point item (14 + (8 x 4 + 5) + 9 + 30 = 90).

Once the judging is complete, make sure to retrieve the items from the table, as they are '''not''' automatically returned. However, the items can be retrieved at the Lost and Found in the [[Mayor's Manor]] should the player forget to retrieve them before leaving the fair.

{{Quote|Dear &lt;player>,&lt;p>One week from today, we are holding the Stardew Valley Fair in the town square!&lt;/p>&lt;p>It's the biggest event of the year, drawing people from all across the country to our humble town.&lt;/p>&lt;p>If you'd like, you can set up a grange display for the event. Just bring up to 9 items that best showcase your talents. You'll be judged on the quality and diversity of your display.&lt;/p>&lt;p>The fair starts at 9 AM... don't miss it!&lt;/p>-Mayor Lewis}}

==Trivia==
* Placing [[Lewis|Mayor Lewis]]' Purple Shorts in the grange display results in him becoming upset and giving the player 750 star tokens to keep his secret. Marnie also comments on the "purple lettuce" in the display.	
* When going to the barbecue where [[Gus]] is preparing food, [[Evelyn]] comments that she wishes that he would provide vegetarian options. However, the burgers that are being served share a sprite with the "Survival Burger" item, which is made out of vegetarian options ([[bread]], [[Cave Carrot|cave carrot]], and [[eggplant]]).
* If the player speaks to [[Caroline]], she says that [[Pierre]] has "been setting aside the best-looking produce for weeks in preparation" for the fair. However, his grange display contains produce that would spoil after sitting for weeks in real life.
* The close-up window shown when playing the Spinning Wheel game shows the wheel in front of two tents, but outside the close-up window it's in the middle of Pelican Town square with no tents behind it.
* After Stardew Valley Fair, [[Jack-O-Lantern]]s spawn in front of multiple houses in Pelican Town. 4 [[Decorative Lantern]]s also spawn in the graveyard.
* In even years, the [[Dwarf]] can be seen among the barrels beneath the path from the farm to Pelican Town.

==Bugs==
* The Fortune Teller refers to the [[Dwarf]] as "she" even though the Dwarf's gender in the game data is "undefined" (&lt;samp>Content\Data\NPCDispositions.xnb&lt;/samp>). That's due to the way the gender check in the code is written, with all non-males defaulting to "she" and no checks for "undefined" genders.
* When playing the fishing mini-game, pressing the button assigned to "use tool" the moment the fish is collected will result in the game glitching and it causes the player to be able to catch another fish. The pole is invisible, however, and the next fish caught is also invisible. There is also extra delay time after collecting the invisible fish. However, the game still gives points.
*Prior to 1.6 , the Fortune Teller would always comment on the player's [[Combat]] skill if it were at least 1, instead of the skill the player had the highest level in.

    &lt;ref Name="initialVelocity>See &lt;samp>Menus/WheelSpinGame::WheelSpinGame&lt;/samp> in the game code. There are 30 possible initial velocities, and given the constant rate of deceleration (without Luck), and starting position of 0 (pointing straight up), their final position can be precalculated. Of these 30 velocities, only 7 result in Orange being selected, compared to 23 for Green.&lt;/ref>
