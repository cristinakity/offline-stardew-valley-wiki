<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Great_Friends">Great Friends</span></h2>
<p>According to the article's table, you must achieve Great Friends as part of attaining perfection. For this, you must "reach maximum hearts with every villager". So who is a villager in this case? The Villagers page lists non-giftables, so its objective seems to go beyond the intention here.
</p><p>The Friendship page identifies friendship boosts to various subgroups. The Luau can confer extra points only for those you have met who actually live in town (not Sandy, Wizard, Krobus, or Dwarf, and not Kent in year 1). No mention of Leo, which poses additional questions.
</p><p>The Bulletin Board bundles for the Community Center confer boosts only to "non-datable villagers" you have met: impossible for Leo (pre-Ginger Island) but including the above excluded list, who are now "villagers" without actually living in town.
</p><p>So, the Wiki is not exactly consistent. And where does that leave us in this article? I think it needs to be more explicit. Since it is very likely to take over two years to achieve perfection anyway, I guess it would be reasonable to conclude the idea that we need to be at 10 hearts with Leo. We should say so anyway. And what exactly IS "maximum hearts" with datable villagers? Eight hearts? Or is it ten, and then where does that leave us with regard to social disgracing because of romancing every datable? Finally, is this ten hearts with our spouse, or is it thirteen, or 12.5, as various other game elements set? And what if our spouse is another player in multiplayer?
</p><p>So, the article needs help, but it's a mixed bag of tangled questions to sort it out. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:27, 10 April 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>So, what if "villager" meant any NPC who lives in Pelican Town, and "valley dweller" meant any NPC who lives in Stardew Valley (including villagers). And then perhaps "non-datable valley dwellers" would need ten hearts and "datable villagers" would need eight. Of course, if that's the way it's supposed to work! <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:34, 10 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>For simplicity and ease of understanding, I think "Villager" should remain a synonym for "NPC". The <a href="../Villagers.html" title="Villagers">Villagers</a> page lists three categories:
<ul><li>Marriage Candidates</li>
<li>Non-marriage candidates</li>
<li>Non-giftable NPCs</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I think that's a good place to start. For the purposes of Perfection, that's really all you need. Non-giftable NPCs can't receive gifts or accumulate friendship, so they don't interfere with Perfection. I know that if you aren't dating a Marriage Candidate, 8 hearts is sufficient for Perfection. Beyond that I have assumed it was the maximum you could achieve in their current state, so 14 hearts with your spouse, 10 hearts with all non-Marriage Candidates and with Marriage Candidates you are dating, and 8 hearts with Marriage Candidates you are not dating. I have not tried to push the boundaries of the friendship element of Perfection to verify those assumptions.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Further discussion of the various categories of Villagers should probably happen on <a href="../Talk_Villagers.html" title="Talk:Villagers">Talk:Villagers</a>.</dd>
<dd><a href="../User_Zendowolf.html" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zendowolf.html" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 19:59, 11 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks. I agree the three main categories suffice for Perfection, since perfection requires everything and everyone. 10 hearts for non-datables and 8 for datables seems enough to say initially, until (unless) any further verifications are forthcoming. Your suggestions make sense, but the game code could be made more complex or less for datables, and still understandable. The investigation/benefit ratio seems small though.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I'm less partial to those categories in general, since there seem to be exceptions in just about every other feature that engages friendship. Simplicity and ease in describing the game behavior is not so simple or easy, nor is remembering it all. "Town dweller" might be a useful additional term for Luau descriptions. Or maybe we just continue begging the point. It is what it is, and it is not consistent. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 22:27, 12 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>According to MouseyPounds' "Stardew Checkup" app, Leo is not needed at all in order to satisfy the requirements for Great Friends perfection. Apparently, Perfection, like all other friendship-related categories, does not use "villager" as a synonym for NPC.
</p><p>In addition, the app says it is also sufficient for purposes of Perfection to have 8-heart-minimum relationships with all dateables. Apparently, spouse relationship does not require anything additional, except that it will for the 7th stardrop. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 18:24, 13 April 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Stardrops">Stardrops</span></h2>
<p>So, you need 7 stardrops to achieve perfection, and one can only be had from your spouse. So, it's not possible to achieve perfection and still be a bachelor? I thought bachelorhood was always a playing option, and it's one I sometimes want to pursue. Doesn't this present a conflict for player choices, or rather, a reduction of options? How about the 6 other stardrops to achieve perfection - just for bachelors, or maybe for everyone? <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 23:53, 10 April 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>One can divorce after receiving a Stardrop. Or don't marry and have Krobus as a housemate, he gives a Stardrop just as spouses would, and he can be evicted similar how you divorce. <a href="../User_Dubesor.html" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Dubesor.html" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 00:04, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>But divorce destroys friendship and it cannot be regained at a maximum level, so perfection cannot be maintained either. I want bachelorhood, not marriage then divorce. It's not the same. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 05:25, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>When divorcing the friendship is not "destroyed", you can pay 30,000 in the Dark Shrine of Memory and erase your ex-spouse's memory and it will be like the wedding never happened, and like <a href="../User_Dubesor.html" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> said, you can have Krobus as a housemate instead of getting married. <a href="../User_JaksStrange.html?title=User:JaksStrange&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JaksStrange (page does not exist)">JaksStrange</a> (<a href="../User_talk_JaksStrange.html" title="User talk:JaksStrange">talk</a>) 10:09, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks both of you for trying to help. I haven't yet explained my intent in full detail, but it's still not the same. So there's a game workaround, but I have to pay 30000g for it, and I'll need to spend game time on the whole marriage thing that could have been directed elsewhere. Not really my aim. But if I need to go on, so be it.</dd>
<dd>The point is, I'll remember. You assume roles to play the game, and you choose roles and activities that are fun. Do you want a pet? Yes? No? Pick one. You have a choice, and it raises no significant barriers either way. Farm slimes? Farm fish? Farm anything? You have a choice. You can do these minimally and still complete the collections coverage, then abandon them again. No significant barriers, and the game still has fun things you can imagine doing.</dd>
<dd>But marriage? What is it fun to imagine there? That really depends on who you are and what you know. I'm married in real life. Who can I imagine being married to, and how fun is that? When you play, you don't leave your own life completely behind. The marriage choice alters life itself, real or imagined. For some people, a divorce is worse than a death. I have heard it described to me in just those words, though I have not experienced it. And I myself hate divorce. I can't imagine it, and I don't want to. That imagining would destroy my playing. No more fun. If I play a marriage, I play it for keeps. If I play bachelorhood, it is a choice I can make. Both may be fun. But the game workaround is no workaround for me. So I have to ask, why can't I complete the game as a bachelor? I don't always want to make a choice to marry. That I can't make that choice strikes me as an avoidable negative in the game.</dd>
<dd>What say you, CA (if you hear about this)? I don't use reddit. Another personal choice. And I'm willing to walk away from questions or games on that basis. I can imagine that, too. No hard feelings anyone. But my recommendation is not to play too lightly with marriage. It can strike deep. It's supposed to. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 16:31, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>We provided you the information of the gameplay mechanics. For feedback or game suggestions I recommend posting in the forums (linked on the left), as the wiki isn't the right place for such things. <a href="../User_Dubesor.html" title="User:Dubesor">Dubesor</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Dubesor.html" title="User talk:Dubesor">talk</a>) 16:39, 11 April 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, I am aware. I do not use the forums at all. It's just that you seemed to want to know my reasons for not pursuing marriage/divorce. I doubt my feedback would count. I'm not mainstream. I'll just try to come up with a cheat to get around the problem. Thanks for your help. Sorry if you find me an irritation. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 18:31, 13 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Total_required">Total required</span></h2>
<p>In the table there's a coloumn "total required". But is isn't the total that is shown ingame. I mean: If you have cooked 50% of all dishes, the total perfection breakdown will get +5% points (instead 10% when cooking 100% of all dishes). But if you get 50% of all Monster Eradication Goals the Perfection breakdown won't gain any points until you have reached all Eradication goals. So the "total required" coloumn should show "Yes" or "all" instead "100%". Same with the Stardrops, the game checks for the Perfection counter only if you have found all Stardrops or not, and not 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. Or am I wrong^^? <a href="../User_Botautal.html" title="User:Botautal">Botautal</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Botautal.html?title=User_talk:Botautal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Botautal (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 20:53, 24 April 2021 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'd go with what the game says. It's up to the teacher whether a question is all-or-nothing, or partial credit. <a href="../User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 15:02, 26 April 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span id="Produce_&amp;_Forage_Shipped"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Produce_.26_Forage_Shipped">Produce &amp; Forage Shipped</span></h2>
<p>The details of how to complete this stated that you needed to ship one of every crop &amp; forage. After some testing on a new file I've found that this is incorrect, you have to ship one of everything in the Items Shipped (farm &amp; forage) tab in the collections menu. I have made changes to indicate this. --<a href="../User_ItsFreakinEthan.html?title=User:ItsFreakinEthan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:ItsFreakinEthan (page does not exist)">ItsFreakinEthan</a> (<a href="../User_talk_ItsFreakinEthan.html?title=User_talk:ItsFreakinEthan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:ItsFreakinEthan (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:01, 24 August 2021 (UTC)
