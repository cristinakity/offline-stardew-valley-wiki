==Second Prismatic Slime==
Hi, I just get the second Prismatic Slime and Jelly. I am not sure if this is important or not. Should I point this out in the article?

P.S. I gave one Jelly to Wizard and another jar is stayed. 
[[User:Dimitrit|Dimitrit]] ([[User talk:Dimitrit|talk]]) 15:15, 3 April 2021 (UTC)
:Hi Dimitrit!  I don't think the page needs to be changed, since it does not say "you can collect only 1 prismatic slime per quest".  You can't sell Prismatic Slime, or use it for anything other than finishing the quest, so it's not really important.  It's a unique item to have in a chest, but not really useful.  I hope this helps!  [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 18:14, 3 April 2021 (UTC)

==Prismatic Slime can also be found in Quarry Mine==
Hi, I just found a Prismatic Slime in Quarry Mine in case that you want to add that in the Prismatic Slime info. [[User:Mobley|Mobley]] ([[User talk:Mobley|talk]]) 19:37, 26 May 2021 (UTC)
:Done, thank you! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 20:12, 26 May 2021 (UTC)

==Large Slimes and Red Cabbage Seeds?==
An edit has been made to state that large slimes can drop red cabbage seeds, referring to GreenSlime::getExtraDropItems.  In the code, Large Slimes related to BigSlime, not GreenSlime.  The code in getExtraDropItems appears to be for Iridium Slimes that are first generation i.e. not the product of 2 slimes mating. [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 07:07, 6 July 2021 (UTC)
:Thanks for the info!  I'm 99% certain I encountered a Big purple slime dropping a red cabbage seed in the Skull Cavern, and went looking for the source in the code... It seems I referenced the wrong code.  Will remove the reference and continue looking for the source.  (Any help there would be appreciated, btw ;) Thanks, [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:26, 6 July 2021 (UTC)
::Did the big slime break into smaller slimes? These could drop the seeds. [[User:BlaDe|BlaDe]] ([[User talk:BlaDe|talk]]) 21:59, 6 July 2021 (UTC)
:::Nope, it was the last monster in the room, and it didn't produce any smaller slimes. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 14:03, 7 July 2021 (UTC)

==Refined quartz drops from near-white slimes?==
I have been breeding white or near-white (unsure of exact values) slimes in my slime hutch and they frequently drop refined quartz, which isn't listed as a drop as far as I can see. I'm wearing a burglar ring if that matters. Not sure if this should be noted somewhere. [[User:Samkee00|Samkee00]] ([[User talk:Samkee00|talk]]) 08:14, 23 January 2022 (UTC)
:Thanks so much for your comment, I've found the drop in the code and added it to the page! If you hadn't been breeding white slimes, I don't think anyone would've noticed it. Amazing. Thanks again! [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 15:41, 23 January 2022 (UTC)
::Hooray! Always happy to discover something new. [[User:Samkee00|Samkee00]] ([[User talk:Samkee00|talk]]) 05:43, 24 January 2022 (UTC)

== Semi-transparent Slimes ==

The Galaxy Soul article's lead mentions that in dangerous mines (or Skull Cavern), that "semi-transparent big slimes" can sometimes be seen, and may contain a Galaxy Soul, which will drop when they are killed.

This article's Big Slimes section contains no mention of semi-transparent ones at all. It discusses only the big slimes that are found in the standard-danger mines. Neither does the Dangerous Slimes section discuss any type of special big slime, which presumably these semi-transparent ones are. Or are they more dangerous? Or simply a special type found only in dangerous mines? It would be nice to know what kind of adversary they really are, and what the chances are of finding a Galaxy Soul in them. And are other such special drops possible? A Prismatic Shard perhaps? I have no way to look at code, and my current experience does not readily lend any hints. Generally, when I have seen such things, I've been battling a half-dozen or more various enemies, and found it hard to distinguish what damage or drops come from where. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 23:28, 28 November 2023 (UTC)
:All good questions. The way you know a semi-transparent big slime is if you see a prize inside it (a galaxy soul, pink cake, Qi gem, or hearts). Otherwise, it's not a semi-transparent big slime. So, the "Big Slimes" portion of the article hints at their existence by describing their drops. They're not more dangerous than Big Slimes found in the dangerous mines/skull cavern that don't have a visible prize inside. Additionally, not all monsters that drop Galaxy Souls are Big Slimes that have a visible galaxy soul inside them. But Galaxy Souls drop only in the dangerous mines or skull cavern. 
:As for the percentages, I don't know, other than what's listed on the [[Galaxy Soul]] page. I'm 99.99% positive I didn't add that information to the wiki. Unfortunately, with v1.6 on the horizon, researching the drop % won't be at the very top of my "to do" list. But I will add it. [[User:Margotbean|margotbean]] ([[User talk:Margotbean|talk]]) 05:59, 29 November 2023 (UTC)
:: tbh not sure what a semitransparent big slime is either, aren't they all semitransparent? But yeah, some of them can carry stuff - galaxy souls, qi gems in the hard mines, pink cakes, and also those little hearts. It's in the BigSlime constructor. [[User:Atravita|Atravita]] ([[User talk:Atravita|talk]]) 12:54, 29 November 2023 (UTC)
:::Atravita, it's that nebulous appearance of big slimes that made me question "transparent, or not?", like you.
:::Thanks for all the clarifications, Margotbean. I think it's the fact that the information is distributed, plus some "opaque" presentation in [[Slimes]], that also made things hard to understand. I'm going to try a bit of editing on it all for that purpose. I think the drop % is all there, just not clearly presented.
:::What's missing is any mention anywhere that big slimes can occur in [[The Mines]]. Either big slimes should have a page of their own, or else they need a high-level section that can be linked to from anywhere. They're really a separate monster from the smaller slimes. And each monster on its own page lists all its possible drops, which is handy. So there's a better improvement prospect for the 1.6 timeframe.
:::I don't do any "social" media. I'd appreciate an estimate for 1.6 targeted release date, if you know. Thanks! [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 00:06, 30 November 2023 (UTC)

:::I've finished the edits I promised. Hope you find them helpful. [[User:Giles|Giles]] ([[User talk:Giles|talk]]) 01:49, 30 November 2023 (UTC)

==Yellow Slimes Give Money?==
Hello, while playing 1.6 I killed a Yellow slime in the mines and it dropped 1500 G, but I couldn't find much on it. [[User:Boger65435|Boger65435]] ([[User talk:Boger65435|talk]]) 06:47, 7 April 2024 (UTC)

Can confirm. Found one on level 7 of the mines and it dropped 250 G. I had made an edit but it was removed for an unspecified reason. --[[User:SillyCrow|SillyCrow]] ([[User talk:SillyCrow|talk]]) 01:59, 9 April 2024 (UTC)
