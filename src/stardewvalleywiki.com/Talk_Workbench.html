</p><p>I noticed anomalies when using a Workbench recently (an object I had never used before - never seemed useful to me). So I ran a savepoint I have to create a test scenario, and tried a couple of things. I think I have an understanding of Workbenches now, and am fashioning the requisite corrections (pretty much a complete rewrite). So here's the warning that it's coming, and might be worth checking out in case I missed something.

<dl><dd>Word to the wise: You might want to hold off until v1.6 is released. Also, normally changes like this require a code reference. I know you won't have one of those, so perhaps one of us in the wiki community can find one. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:32, 6 January 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Article correction complete. Hope it's not too much of a problem at this time for the other languages, but almost all of the article's central text was in error. At least it's not extensive text. <a href="User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 19:47, 6 January 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Sorry Margot. My page updated here only after I'd saved the article change. I've reversed that now. But at least it can be looked at through versioning. I hope that it can be reinstated soon. 1.6 seems to be taking a lot longer than I would have expected. It's a nuisance also to be shut down on the wiki for months. <a href="User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 19:52, 6 January 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>It's ok, I've reinstated the edit. For some reason that I can't defend, I was thinking the edit would involve the order of items taken inside chests (meaning left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or vice-versa), in general, more detail than what the edit ended up being. I've reinstated the edit, as it seems to be completely verifiable through gameplay. Sorry for the inconvenience! <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 22:35, 6 January 2024 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks, Margot! I did have that feeling too. So glad it can be there for everyone right away. It really does make a difference in how you lay out the work area, just as the Mini-Fridges can be subtle that way. I think the main difference in planning lies in the fact that fridges often use ingredients that have quality ratings, whereas crafting usually doesn't. But I organize my chests as caches for one or another set of purposes, and some items have multiple purposes, which are often distributed among chests. I find it's helpful to be orderly about which cache I take things from first: setting priorities. I suppose I'm an oddball this way, but yes, I engineer my play. <a href="User_Giles.html" title="User:Giles">Giles</a> (<a href="User_talk_Giles.html" title="User talk:Giles">talk</a>) 19:21, 7 January 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi there! I've found a small bug relating to the Workbench. I was holding a Warp Totem and right-clicking to use the Workbench. However, what it instead did was make the "close interface" sound and lock me out of the Workbench. I was not warped, but neither can I use the Workbench. I broke the Workbench with a tool and put it back, but the game thinks that a "nearby chest is being used". I suspect that this will happen when holding any item which has a right-click use, but this is a tenuous and untested theory. Anyway, I was hoping a bug section could be added to include this. Thanks! <a href="User_Soap-the-gamer.html" title="User:Soap-the-gamer">Soap-the-gamer</a> (<a href="User_talk_Soap-the-gamer.html" title="User talk:Soap-the-gamer">talk</a>) 00:46, 20 February 2024 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>First you need to report the bug on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../external.html?link=https://forums.stardewvalley.net/">official forums</a>, be sure to include version, platform, single-player/multiplayer, and any mods you're using. After that, we can see if it's already fixed in v1.6. Then, finally, we can consider adding the bug to the page, if it seems like it might be a common occurrence. Tenuous and untested bugs generally wouldn't be good candidates, as you might have guessed. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 00:53, 20 February 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>
