<dl><dd>Try refreshing the page, or switching to "Desktop" view and then back. The wiki remembers your settings for some pages (for example, when I test mobile view on one page, some other pages will also display in mobile view, but not all of them.) Also make sure your "Preferences" are set to "Vector" and not "MinervaNeue". <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:34, 25 January 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I hadn't actually tested on mobile; this was on a desktop browser. I checked on my phone, and non-desktop mode shows the correct template. When I switch to desktop mode, it goes back to the wrong template. I had tested on both Chrome and Chromium on my PC and they both exhibited the same issue, with cleared cache and cookies. I also checked in empty profiles in Firefox and Edge (both on PC) and they both exhibit the same issue. <a href="User_Techhat.html?title=User:Techhat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Techhat (page does not exist)">Techhat</a> (<a href="User_talk_Techhat.html?title=User_talk:Techhat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Techhat (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 14:43, 25 January 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I've noticed you've used those filters to make makeshift title and username blacklists.

<p>Hello dear Admin.
I'm not sure what's going on but this has been happening for months however it hasn't always been like this. I can't remember when it started but it's been at least I believe six months. I thought it could have been my extentions but I tested and it wasn't. I'm using Opera GX and I checked with Google and this didn't happen. Could it be Opera GX interacting in some way? Is it a glitch? The only way I can describe it is that it looks like black and white were inverted and maybe the color contrast was cranked up. Any idea how to fix this if it's not a bug? <a href="User_Tiptoe50.html?title=User:Tiptoe50&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Tiptoe50 (page does not exist)">Tiptoe50</a> (<a href="User_talk_Tiptoe50.html?title=User_talk:Tiptoe50&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Tiptoe50 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:47, 4 June 2023

<p>Is there something going on with the wiki server? Since 1.6.9 released my bookmarked searches have been failing even though the URLs match the local search URL format precisely. Searching locally is also very slow. I just tried to log in to post about it and the server crashed entirely for a few minutes leaving only the Cloudflare cache, which is obviously only viable for anons. Previewing and submitting this question has also been really slow. Half of my pageloads have no CSS or partial CSS. Is it just excessive normal traffic?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Furniture_large_edit_revert"><a href="Furniture.html" title="Furniture">Furniture</a> large edit revert</span></h2>
<p>I thought that the formatting was really bad on that page. The first issue was that tons of unneded and obvious info was repeated, like the fact that all catalogue items cost 0G when bought in the catalogue. The second issue was with the user experience - it was really hard to tell at a glance which items were available from a catalogue and which weren't. All in all, it seemed like the tables were prioritizing space efficiency over user experience.
</p><p>So, I decided to remake it, and you can see my finished result <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mediawiki/indexf8fd.html?title=Furniture&amp;oldid=183857">here</a>. 10 hours later, it was reverted without explanation. I don't want to start an edit war, so I'm requesting the permission to revert it back and assurance that it won't be reverted again.
</p><p>Also, the icons I uploaded for use in the rewrite were deleted without explanation as well.
