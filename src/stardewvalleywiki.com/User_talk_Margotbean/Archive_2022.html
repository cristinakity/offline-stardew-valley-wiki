<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Prismatic_Jelly_and_Ectoplasm">Prismatic Jelly and Ectoplasm</span></h2>
<p>Hello, I'm pretty sure you can gift villagers prismatic jelly and ectoplasm during their respective special order quest, I swear I saw the gift icon pops up as you pass by any NPC (not just the wizard) with it in your hotbar, though I've already completed the quest so I can't get you a screenshot. You can definitely gift it using the spawn feature by naming your character or animal <code>[875][876]</code>. <a href="../User_Infiaria.html?title=User:Infiaria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Infiaria (page does not exist)">Infiaria</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Infiaria.html?title=User_talk:Infiaria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Infiaria (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:42, 9 January 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hi Infiaria! Correct you are, I have seen the gift box icon over villagers' heads too, but when you click on them, the game pops up an "Incorrect person" message in the lower left of the screen. If you wear a Burglar's Ring and get 2 of the item (without ID spawning), the same thing happens after you complete the quest and before the extra item disappears. So, except for very specific circumstances, the game makes sure the item is not giftable.</dd>
<dd>I will add a trivia note to the pages, similar to the one on the <a href="../Stardrop.html" title="Stardrop">Stardrop</a> page, that indicates the item can be spawned and given as a universally hated gift. ok? Thanks for pointing this out. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:18, 9 January 2022 (UTC)

<p>Heyo
</p><p>I was playing Stardew Valley recently, and encountered a very unusual bug: I was going to fulfill a request for Lewis when, once I interacted with him, a bat sound effect played, and he jumped in surprise, then showed a hate bubble appear over his head. This continued to happen, regardless of what I did (Even shooting him with my master slingshot to see if I could trigger the dialogue for it! [It did not work, and just made me feel a little bad&#160;:/ ...]). Do you know anything about this? <a href="../User_Fnaticlyric560.html" title="User:Fnaticlyric560">Fnaticlyric560</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Fnaticlyric560.html" title="User talk:Fnaticlyric560">talk</a>) 21:30, 11 January 2022 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Standardize_hotfix_format_in_version_history">Standardize hotfix format in version history</span></h2>
<p>Hi! Hotfixes don't change the version number and they're usually small, so they're a bit awkward to show on <a href="../Version_History.html" title="Version History">Version History</a>. We've historically handled them pretty inconsistently; for example:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="../Version_History.html#1.5.5" title="Version History">1.5.5</a>+ shows each hotfix as a separate release with its own section like <i>1.5.6 (hotfix 2022-12-22)</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../Version_History.html#1.5.3" title="Version History">1.5.3</a> lists the hotfixes in the intro, then merges their changes into the main release with markers like ¹.</li>
<li><a href="../Version_History.html#1.5.1" title="Version History">1.5.1</a> says <i>some fixes were deployed in three unversioned hotfixes</i>, then merges their changes into the main release without distinguishing them.</li></ul>
<p>I want to standardize how they're handled, but I'm not sure what's the best format to use. What do you think of one section per version number, with hotfixes listed at the bottom (<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://imgur.com/wZSTFTX">see mockup</a>)? —<small><a href="../User_Pathoschild.html" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pathoschild.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild">talk</a>) 23:41, 13 January 2022 (UTC)</small>
</p>
<dl><dd>Definitely the mockup! I dislike seeing "hotfix" in the headers and TOC in such a big font like v1.5.5; I do like v1.5.3, but if the little "1" or asterisk (or whatever marker we use to denote the hotfix) is accidentally deleted, then we may be searching page history for hours to reconcile it -- it's too fragile a system. I don't like losing info (like v1.5.1) at all.</dd>
<dd>The only thing I somewhat don't like about the mockup is that it violates the "newest version at the top" rule... but the hotfixes are unversioned, and the format makes sense within the version section.</dd>
<dd>So, there you have it, my vote is for the mockup 100%.&#160;:) <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:32, 14 January 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>It was a bit harder to read in practice, so I tweaked the design to more clearly separate hotfixes from the main release. I migrated <a href="../Version_History.html#1.5.3" title="Version History">1.5.3</a> through <a href="../Version_History.html#1.5.6" title="Version History">1.5.6</a>; how does that look? —<small><a href="../User_Pathoschild.html" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pathoschild.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild">talk</a>) 00:37, 19 January 2022 (UTC)</small>
<dl><dd>Hope you don't mind if I add my two cents. I like the new format in general, but I don't like that the dates of the hotfixes are buried in the middle/end of the section. If I look at the section for 1.5.6, it says, "Stardew Valley 1.5.6 was released on 21 December 2021." Unless I scroll down, I don't see that a hotfix was applied yesterday. I am misled into thinking I have the most recent version. So I would like the hotfixes to be acknowledged in that introductory sentence/paragraph. Unfortunately, doing that may force a change in how you introduce the hotfixes in the hotfix box. <a href="../User_Zendowolf.html" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zendowolf.html" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 15:47, 19 January 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I made a couple of formatting tweaks to the gray box around the hotfixes, what do you think? Other than those formatting tweaks, I think it looks great! I don't see a way around having the hotfixes at the bottom of the section, but the gray box makes them stand out more. The alternative would be to start the section with a sentence describing a hotfix without first discussing the major release, which doesn't really make sense to me. I await your feedback, and please let me know when I can copy the new template to the other languages.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I tend to agree, so I added a note saying when the last hotfix was on the most current version, although whether or not we want to track that going forward is another debate. <a href="../User_KNakamura.html" title="User:KNakamura">KNakamura</a> (<a href="../User_talk_KNakamura.html?title=User_talk:KNakamura&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:KNakamura (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 17:19, 19 January 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>So, now we have the problem of v1.5.6 not matching the other versions again. I think we should mention the hotfixes in the intro paragraph for all versions, or none. Otherwise, the whole topic of standardization is moot. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:35, 19 January 2022 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I've updated <a href="../Template_MainLinks.html" title="Template:MainLinks">Template:MainLinks</a> to the current version as of Jan. 18, so I've removed the "last hotfixed" sentence from <a href="../Version_History.html" title="Version History">Version History</a>. Anyone who would like to add hotfix dates to the intro paragraphs for all versions is totally free to do so, I would not mind at all!

<dl><dd>I added a sentence to each version that has a hotfix box to indicate the dates. I did not include a leading zero for the day (if less than 10), then noticed that some dates do have a leading zero and others do not. One date is Month DD, YYYY instead of DD Month YYYY. Should that be consistent, and if so, how? <a href="../User_Zendowolf.html" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zendowolf.html" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 20:19, 19 January 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thank you, Zendowolf! It looks great! And it solves everyone's concerns.</dd>
<dd>Yes, the dates should absolutely be consistent. As for format, it's totally your choice. I only have 3 suggestions: (1) Keep the name of the month and don't substitute a number, (2) keep the year last, and (3) don't introduce "th" or "rd" (as in 14th or 3rd). If you have no preference, I suppose I like DD Month YYYY. It matches our signatures on talk pages, and it's understandable by people who normally put day first as well as us weird Americans who normally put month before day. But, if you strongly prefer Month DD, YYYY or another variant, go for it.&#160;:) Thank you again!! <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 20:35, 19 January 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I'm pretty sure it was "here's 1.5.1 and by the way, here's what we changed in the hotfixes we applied to 1.5" (also included in 1.5.1).

<p>Hello, new to the wiki and wanted to contribute without making a mess of things. I noticed the Traveling Cart page has been marked as a stub because it hasn't been updated to 1.5.

<p>Hi margotbean,
Since you're an admin, can you update the Egg Festival page for these 18-egg videos? I can't add them since they contain external links.

<dl><dd>Hey Infiaria, people have tried to add that link (the human one) before, but the background music is so LOUD and OBNOXIOUS, I can't in good conscience add it to the page -- I just can't do that to unsuspecting wiki users. There's also no proof that 18 eggs is any kind of world record, as far as I can tell. The tool assisted video is a cheat, so not really appropriate. I'm sorry for the bad news. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 21:37, 6 March 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Thanks for the response margotbean.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I can see why you don't want the human record one (the sound is horrifying) but I don't clearly see why the TAS one isn't allowed. TAS isn't "cheating" in the traditional sense—that would be if like, the speed was set artificially set higher, more eggs were added in, or mods were included. TAS represents the highest percentage of what is physically possible, and it is not only physically possible, but humanly possible: you just seen it in that obnoxious video.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You also say that there's no proof that 18 eggs is a world record... well, first of all, if 18 eggs isn't a world record, there should exist one with 19 eggs (or higher), right? And, secondly, the second video with 14 eggs is titled "EGG HUNT RECORD"—this is misleading, is it not? Someone pedantic like me could also say the commentary in that video is annoying and unnecessary. (The first video is nice though.)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>If, at least, you still don't want to add the TAS video in, maybe include a Trivia section say that the theoretical maximum achievable eggs that can be collected in Vanilla Stardew Valley is 18? (Again, you might say there's no proof, but if TAS can't achieve 19, then it's impossible. Plus, you can always update it if it somehow is.)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Um, so finally. I have an image with the route with 18 eggs as shown in the video. Can that be added? Though it seems that uploading images is broken at the moment—don't know if it's just me. I'll try again tomorrow. <a href="../User_Infiaria.html?title=User:Infiaria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Infiaria (page does not exist)">Infiaria</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Infiaria.html?title=User_talk:Infiaria&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Infiaria (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:54, 6 March 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Why don't we remove the youtube link to the 14 egg video and replace the 14 egg image with the 18 egg image? On that note, image uploading should be fixed, I have one of the server people looking into it, I'm just waiting for a response. I was unable to upload an image last week, and there was supposedly a fix put in. It might be that you're a new(er) user? I'll see what the server people say.

<p>Hi margotbean,
</p><p>So, I was just looking at the best gifts section of Penny’s page, didn’t)t have any of her loved gifts, and said to myself ‘Oh, well, I’ll just give her a rabbit’s foot.’, forgetting that she was one of the exceptions to the universal loves. I think that in their pages, in the top box thing with quick information, the fact that the two of them hate rabbit’s foot/prismatic shard should be added, so that someone like me who only glances at their best gifts section on the top of the page, doesn’t go around giving Haley prismatic shards like everyone else. Could I add those exceptions to the blue box thingy?

<dl><dd>I see what you're saying, but I think it's just confusing and not actually wrong. It says "Thursday, Friday" but "Friday and Sunday".

It's that way in all four seasons.

<p>I can say with almost absolute certainty that the club's secondary attack cannot deal critical hits, and I tested this extensively in-game.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="List_of_ingredients_used_in_crafting">List of ingredients used in crafting</span></h2>
<p>Hello! Thank you for redirecting me to the existing list of crafting materials! (i.e. <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../User_Margotbean/IngredientsShortList.html">https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Margotbean/IngredientsShortList</a>) This is exactly what I was looking for but couldn't find. I'll do my best to learn more about wiki editing before I try for another big contribution! (Side question: Is there a beginner's guide somewhere with the guidelines for how to contribute to the wiki?)
</p><p>So I was wondering ― Is there a reason why this list hasn't been added to the main wiki? I wasn't able to find it via the wiki search. (In fact, I wasn't even aware that user page resources like this existed.) The cooking page has the full list of ingredients on it, so it seemed appropriate to put a similar list on the main crafting page as well. I think it would be really helpful to have this somewhere with more visibility!

<dl><dd>Hello Xazuo! You may find some useful tips at <a href="../Help_Editing.html" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>. As for the list of ingredients, I never added it to the Crafting page because I simply didn't want to make the page longer. In addition, I find that crafting is something I do on day 1 of gameplay, whereas cooking takes longer. So, the list of ingredients isn't as helpful (by the time I think to look at it, I've already crafted several recipes). It could be added to the page, but I would definitely prefer the <i>short</i> version (a simple list) rather than the huge tables we have on the Cooking page.

</p><p>Hi Margotbean,
</p><p>Using the wiki on a frequent basis, I noticed inconsistencies between the formatting of pages regarding similar subjects.
For instance the schedules of <a href="../Emily.html" title="Emily">Emily</a> and <a href="../Gus.html" title="Gus">Gus</a> are shown in a completely different format from <a href="../Haley.html" title="Haley">Haley</a> and <a href="../Demetrius.html" title="Demetrius">Demetrius</a>. I estimate it to be about 50% of the villagers in one format, and 50% in the other.
</p><p>Now, I was thinking about standardizing these formats and making changes accordingly whenever I notice inconsistencies.
Before I do so though, I figured I'd reach out to you (I was referred to you by PathosChild) to make sure this would be desired and not to step on anyone's toes, especially if these formats have already been considered.
</p><p>If any other help is needed with the wiki, consider me more than open and willing to help! It seems like a lot of fun to me!
</p><p>Cheers,
Sorrol

<dl><dd>Hello Sorrol! The villagers schedules' format was discussed (at length) when the wiki was new. Some villagers' schedules vary by season, and others don't, so the seasonal schedules have one format, and the rest have the other. The schedule dictates the format, in all 12 languages. If you find that the schedule details are inaccurate, however, you're welcome to update them!</dd>

<dl><dd>Use the talk pages to discuss changes to existing templates before they're made, and to gather feedback on newly created ones (you said you're collecting feedback on the format of "executable name"). If you're doing that mostly on discord, that's fine, but definitely use them before making changes to other templates. Let modders know they can comment on the wiki as well. Obviously a template won't have a talk page if we're in the discussion stage, and it's not yet created.</dd>
<dd>I know the other languages' modding sections are in a sorry state. Some of the contributing factors to that are the rapid number of changes made in English, the complexities of the pages, the html mixed with mediawiki syntax, the missing templates, and the frequent page name changes. I'd like to make it as easy as possible for them to translate technical jargon without stumbling over those kinds of issues. I feel awful for them when I see them try, and then give up because they just can't figure out why the page doesn't look right. I've tried to step in and help, and it's taken me way too long to figure it out myself at times. I would like that to change, and give them a fighting chance. After all, they never announce when they've decided to start translating modding pages, they just show up at any time.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tackle_profitability">Tackle profitability</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I see that for some reason you've been re-arranging the text I'm adding about tackle crafting profitability to put it way down at the bottom of the page, I'm going to move everything back to the way I wrote it on the tackle pages and ask that you please stop reverting it. There's no reason at all to move this text down to a Notes section at the bottom, which hides it (I didn't even notice that a more vague note already existed on <a href="../Barbed_Hook.html" title="Barbed Hook">Barbed Hook</a> for example) and contradicts the way that all other similar information on this wiki is formatted.  All profitable recipes on the wiki are formatted the exact same way as I am doing this and have been for years, and it's important information that should be easily visible and these pages are not very large or bloated. So I'd ask that you just let me add this information for the sake of consistency across the wiki if nothing else. - <a href="../User_Emmeka.html?title=User:Emmeka&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Emmeka (page does not exist)">Emmeka</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Emmeka.html" title="User talk:Emmeka">talk</a>) 16:50, 9 July 2022 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I'm afraid I've already explained my reasoning on your talk page. If the pages aren't large, there's no reason the information should be difficult to find in a "Notes" section. I've also asked for your understanding in my decision. So, I'm left with no choice but to let you know that repeatedly reverting edits made by wiki staff is grounds for temporary or permanent banning.

<dl><dd>If you're going to seriously whip out admin powers force this, then I expect you to come up with a solution to format this consistently across all articles and implement it. If you don't, you're just intervening in my attempt to add information to the wiki to force an arbitrary and inconsistent format, for no explicable reason. Threatening to ban me over this is an absurd overreach. I'm the one who's added most of the information about recipe profitability to this wiki over the years, and only now out of the blue years later you're taking issue with how I've been formatting it (a format I did not even create, but copied from earlier articles with the same information for the sake of consistency across the whole wiki), and only for tackle specifically! Or is there any actual reason you are insisting that tackle, and nothing else, have a completely different place in the article for this information than all other articles with similar information? - <a href="../User_Emmeka.html?title=User:Emmeka&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Emmeka (page does not exist)">Emmeka</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Emmeka.html" title="User talk:Emmeka">talk</a>) 17:06, 9 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Please take a breath and calm down. I've already stated my reason for the format, so it isn't "inexplicable". Every page except cooking pages contain profit information in a separate section. A search for the term "profit" will show you the results.</dd>
<dd>A temporary or permanent ban is standard procedure for violating wiki rules, such as repeatedly edit-warring with an Admin, particularly after the Admin has given you an explanation.

<dl><dd>Now I'm beginning to think that for consistency's sake, we leave the pages as is.

We have liks to keg &amp; preserves jar productivity on pages like <a href="../Wine.html" title="Wine">Wine</a> and <a href="../Juice.html" title="Juice">Juice</a>, because the player has a choice of which equipment to use to process the raw ingredients.

<dl><dd>Sorry for being really late on this. I agree, I think keeping the links consistent with other pages like <a href="../Wine.html" title="Wine">Wine</a> is a great idea. However, upon looking at the pages, it isn't the processed goods (such as <a href="../Mayonnaise.html" title="Mayonnaise">Mayonnaise</a>, <a href="../Void_Mayonnaise.html" title="Void Mayonnaise">Void Mayonnaise</a>, and <a href="../Dinosaur_Mayonnaise.html" title="Dinosaur Mayonnaise">Dinosaur Mayonnaise</a>) that have the "Artisan Goods" section but rather the raw goods (such as <a href="../Egg.html" title="Egg">Egg</a>, <a href="../Dinosaur_Egg.html" title="Dinosaur Egg">Dinosaur Egg</a>, and <a href="../Void_Egg.html" title="Void Egg">Void Egg</a>) which means that they are currently not consistent. For consistency's sake, we would have to remove those links from the latter group of pages and put them on the former group of pages. Which means more changes, but it will be worth it. <a href="../User_User314159.html" title="User:User314159">User314159</a> (<a href="../User_talk_User314159.html" title="User talk:User314159">talk</a>) 18:57, 14 July 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hmmm... I like consistency, but I don't think removing the existing links is a good idea. The whole goal is to increase visibility of <a href="../Animal_Products_Profitability.html" title="Animal Products Profitability">Animal Products Profitability</a>. There is an argument to be made that animal products shouldn't be compared to other Artisan Goods that use Preserves Jar/Keg, because the decision to process or not process it depends on different factors (chiefly the Rancher Profession). <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:51, 15 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Image_guidelines">Image guidelines</span></h2>
<p>Hi there, I was just wondering if you had any advice regarding taking photos for the wiki. I had a quick look at <a href="../Help_Editing.html" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a> but it didn't specify anything in particular. Specifically regarding <code>File: Special Order board.png</code>, would it be fine if I just took another one with the tool reticle removed or are there other changes you'd be looking for before such a file is uploaded?

</p>
<dl><dd>Removing the reticle and the snow would be good. Normally Spring images are best, but in this case I think Fall might be better, because it first shows up in Fall (for new games). Generally images taken from the sprite sheet are best, but not for this image. For larger screenshots, you can hit F4 to go into screenshot mode, or use the built-in screenshot button in the options menu. (Again, not needed for this image, but in general).

<dd>I've prepared some <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://imgur.com/a/npk7dlZ">draft images</a> that are in Spring (and somehow I remembered to time it so that the background flower petals weren't obscuring the photo subjects!).

<dl><dd>The 2nd one looks perfect. The first one has one problem: it contains the name of the store ("Pierre's"), which varies in the other languages.

<dl><dd>I honestly don't think we need the image at all. In looking at the <a href="../Quests.html" title="Quests">Quests</a> page, there is ample text under "List of Special Orders" for us to insert an image without adversely affecting the flow of the page. But the "Help Wanted Quests" section already has less text and a large image that continues into the "Achievements" section on wide screens. I also think describing the location of the "help wanted" board is sufficient, really. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 15:18, 17 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>┌──────────┘
</p><p>For the Help Wanted file first: I feel like such a photo would give significantly more context to the information provided, which is generally my goal when editing, regardless if the location is described or not. This is because it let players know what to expect when they go looking for that object, so personally I disagree about the usefulness/necessity.
</p><p>I also don't think that overflowing the section is that much of a deal, especially as it would only flow into the next subsection, which is still related to the Help Wanted Board and full of text that would just reflow around the image. In my editing opinion, I don't think that prose length should really dictate that sort of decision. Also, the draft image is also less than 250px square, which is about the half of most building infobox images, which when combined with the Valley map do currently overflow.
</p><p>As an alternative, I think it might simply be possible to put the whole <a href="../File_Pierres_shop.html" title="File:Pierres shop.png">File:Pierres shop.png</a> photo there as a reference, if that helps avoid issues with translations (that you mentioned earlier) and such. But I think in general it is useful to have a representation of the board, and/or an image of the board's location in some form. That being said, there was tremendous variety when looking up information on small objects in the game for precedent, but do let me know your thoughts about how to proceed there if at all.
</p><p>As for the Special Order Board, which you already mentioned above (17 July) has sufficient general image quality: I'm assume that the&#160;! icon isn't that important, so I'll just upload that one and insert it into the page (and a belated thanks for checking through it before). <a href="../User_Techhead7890.html" title="User:Techhead7890">Techhead7890</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Techhead7890.html" title="User talk:Techhead7890">talk</a>) 01:43, 19 July 2022 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Custom_styles_for_modding_namespace">Custom styles for modding namespace</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I'm looking into simplifying markup on modding pages, to make them easier to edit and translate. One of the big offenders is the custom headers on <a href="../Modding_Player_Guide/Troubleshooting.html" title="Modding:Player Guide/Troubleshooting">Modding:Player Guide/Troubleshooting</a> — they make the page much easier to reference for players (which is important), but they're a pain to edit. The markup is ugly, you can't edit them as sections, and the wiki security often blocks edits to the page (which makes things extra hard for translators copying the page).
</p><p>I was thinking of <a href="../../external.html?link=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TemplateStyles" class="extiw" title="mw:Extension:TemplateStyles">adding a stylesheet</a> to the <a href="../Template_Modding_player_guide_header.html" title="Template:Modding player guide header">|modding header template</a> for the custom styles like that. Then the markup on the page will change from this:
</p>
<div class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-html mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr"><pre><span></span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">h1</span> <span class="na">style</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;border: 2px solid rgb(0, 116, 72); background: rgba(3, 160, 7, 0.1); padding: 1em; margin-bottom:0;&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>The basics<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">h1</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To just this:
</p>
<pre>= The basics =</pre>
<p>Then we only need to copy the template styles once to each wiki, and all the modding pages are nice and simple to translate without baking styles into the markup. Any objections? —<small><a href="../User_Pathoschild.html" title="User:Pathoschild">Pathoschild</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pathoschild.html" title="User talk:Pathoschild">talk</a>) 21:16, 16 July 2022 (UTC)</small>

<dl><dd>I think moving CSS out of the page is a great idea! I'm not sure it will work with <a href="../Template_Modding_player_guide_header.html" title="Template:Modding player guide header">Modding:Player Guide/header</a>, since it's not a template, though. You might have to create a new template to use a template stylesheet.</dd>
<dd>So, if you make <a href="../Template_Modding_player_guide_header.html" title="Template:Modding player guide header">Modding:Player Guide/header</a> into a true template it will affect 4 other languages that have already been translated. That's a fair bit of work, I wouldn't mind help with copying changes to the other languages.</dd>
<dd>Also, I tried stripping out almost all the CSS from  <a href="../Modding_Player_Guide/Troubleshooting.html" title="Modding:Player Guide/Troubleshooting">Modding:Player Guide/Troubleshooting</a>, and it still gave me the "you've been blocked from the wiki" page error when editing the whole page. So, just changing the h1 styles won't solve all the problems with editing the page. I even discussed it with the server people, they said it's a cloudflare thing, and there is a <a href="../User_Prod/Test.html" title="User:Prod/Test">test page</a> that looks extremely simple, but if you try to edit it, you get the same big red "blocked" error page.</dd>
<dd>tl;dr, yes, but I think you'll need an actual template, and I wouldn't mind if you assisted in copying it to the other languages. 😁 <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:27, 17 July 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I never imagined it could have too much unique info. As I opened with, it <i>Serves as a good entry page</i>, and is a perfect resource for those who wonder "What items can have star qualities?" or "What does the star on the item do?" IMO, these questions lack a good answer about quality in general, notably "What's the formulae for quality bonus?" Considering that even with only 4 items, <a href="../Bait.html" title="Bait">Bait</a> still justifies as a page. So does this game mechanism, for sure. - <a href="../User_IBugOne.html" title="User:IBugOne">IBugOne</a> (<a href="../User_talk_IBugOne.html" title="User talk:IBugOne">talk</a>) 19:39, 10 August 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>As per my rationale above, the draft page should now do well on what it's supposed to. It compiles most (if not all) commonalities of the quality star into one page, and links to other pages should a reader wants to learn more about specific categories. The only missing part would be a <i>History</i> section that's common to all pages.

<dd>I still don't see enough unique info to justify having its own page. It <i>might</i> work as a sort of disambiguation page (but not an actual disambiguation page), if it were trimmed down to the basics (4 qualities represented by 4 stars and a 0, 1, 2, or 4 internally), and then a list of links to the various items' quality sections. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:28, 13 August 2022 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Rasmodius">Rasmodius</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I got a message from you. I did not seek to cause any trouble, nor did I want to overstep. I misunderstood how it all worked and thought it would go up for review but not change the page since I’m a new member. Asmodius/Asmodeus (both proper spellings) is a key figure in Judaic lore. The Ars Goetia was of course largely inspired by this. He’s also very connected to magicians, wizards in particular via King Solomon, whom he took the place of and posed as. He’s actually tied to a few other beliefs and cultures, even featuring in a French comedy by Alain-René Le Sage. He’s inspired many characters in many modern stories, and as you said, he is well know in demonology and demonolatry.  I chose that reference because more people associate him with that source, largely due to his popularity in modern times rather than digging into his origins.  Rasmodius probably being inspired by him was just a neat Easter egg. I’ve never posted on anything like this before, but I’m a big fan of cultural, religious, and historical representation. Thank you for your message and your time. I won’t make more edits, as I had actually only made the account because of my excitement. I appreciate your work on this app and the help you provide to fans of Stardew.

<dl><dd>Hello Eya! I didn't send a message per se, but I did revert the edit after googling "Asmodius". There are a lot of dark connotations associated with that particular entity, and I didn't want to introduce that element to the wiki unnecessarily.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Skull_cavern_staircases">Skull cavern staircases</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I tried to explain the <a href="../Skull_Cavern.html" title="Skull Cavern">Skull Cavern</a> staircase technique without going too much into the details, because then it would quickly become a full paragraph or two, and that is probably too much for a page like that with bullet points. Not that easy to explain it in writing either, it's better to see it in action. The technique is <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgs0LqaK7t8">explained here</a> by the current world record holder in iridium ore count (he later somehow managed to gather 11.5k, but there isn't a video about that run as far as I know). Going that fast is incredibly difficult, especially over such a long time, but sometimes you get into a good rhythm, and I've been able to get quite a few "ticks" around 70 floors, and even a few 80s. I learnt about it in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://forums.stardewvalley.net/threads/skull-cavern-dives-and-loot.13295/">this thread</a> on the forum, and on page 5 and 6 have written about the runs. Like I said, tried to write down info about this briefly so people can at least know about it, because I figured going into the gritty details of it would probably just get blanket reverted anyway. It doesn't truly work in MP btw, because the game (in-game clock) doesn't pause then. <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 22:24, 2 September 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I see what happened now, thank you for the explanation.</dd>
<dd>I've been thinking about this for a day now, and I'm not sure how to summarize a speedrunning strategy, or even if it belongs on the wiki. I watched the video, and read most of the forum post, and neither one really does the technique justice. The video also mentions that it's an advanced technique, and the creator isn't going to explain it in the video. So, we have the forum post left. At least one person commented that they couldn't get the hang of it.</dd>
<dd>I'm not totally opposed to adding mentions of speedrunning strategies on the wiki, but I'm not sure how helpful this one really is. I can see that you have used it with great success, and want the same for others. I just don't know if that's realistic.</dd>
<dd>If you can find a good summary of the technique, with no rambling, no disclaimers (such as "I'm not going to explain this technique"), perhaps we can place a link to it on the wiki, labeled "advanced technique".</dd>
<dd>FYI, you can link to a specific comment in a forum post by right-clicking on the number of the post at the top right of it, and copying the link, rather than linking to the entire post.</dd>
<dd>Fair enough? <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:44, 3 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thank you for the feedback. I haven't thought about this as speedrunning tbh, as that is something they do right from the get-go to achieve a pretty specific goal in an absurdly short time. These deep dives is something that can be done on the side in an otherwise normal game. However, it's certainly pretty hardcore and using advanced techniques that aren't obvious or easy to pull off. It requires practice to do well. My thinking was that it would be good to have info about this on the wiki since going to the Skull Cavern is something that probably all players do, if only to try to reach floor 100 for Qi. Particularly as there already was a "strategy" section.</dd>
<dd>Godzilla_Freak explains the technique pretty well in that video, from around 1:40. It's all the other stuff he doesn't really go into, like jade production, needed equipment, how to use the slingshot and so forth. Nor that it's possible to change tools on the inventory screen (I didn't figure this out until much later, on my own). I'm not sure how to best put it down to words in a succinct yet understandable manner. Seeing it in action is easier, and that is when I truly understood it. Therefore, if it's possible to have the video as a reference, perhaps with a time stamp, that would be useful I think.</dd>
<dd>If you think this info would add value to the wiki, either on that page or somewhere else, I can try to write down something about it. I just got up, but felt I had to reply now since it's been several days :blush:. How brief would it have to be? <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 07:21, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Good morning! I was thinking something like:</dd>
<dd><b>Advanced technique:</b> In singleplayer, the pause menu can be utilized to stop time while the level loads. Pressing "Escape" or "E" (by default) to bring up the menu immediately upon entering a level, and then closing it [when???] effectively stops the game clock, gaining valuable time while descending a large number of floors.</dd>
<dd>We need to answer the [when???] question, and then I don't think a reference link to a post or video is necessary. I still don't find the video you linked to all that helpful, and it is quite long. If there's no better source, I think we should just skip it.</dd>
<dd>That's pretty much all we need, I think. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:39, 7 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Hmm, really? I thought he explained it quite well in those few minutes from 1:40-ish. After that he goes into descending very quickly, and later slingsthotting. But that little section of the video is what made me understand it at least.
<ul><li>The technique: Press "E" upon entering a new level. This brings up the inventory and pauses the in-game clock. The floor proceeds to fully load in while the game is effectively paused, and after the fading in from black is complete (usually 1-2 seconds, but probably depends on PC specs), one can unpause again by hitting "E". However, this next step is also crucial in descending fast. While the inventory is up, you hold down both mouse buttons while the mouse pointer hovers on a tile next to the farmer (I prefer left or right). This means that when you unpause the game, you will instantly place a ladder and go down, with next to no 'wasted' time. To save time in case that tile is occupied with e.g. a torch or stone, you can double-pause (E+E) when you unpause the game. That means that you instantly pause again if the tile you hover is invalid, therefore losing very little time. And if the tile is free, you instantly go down the stairs without re-pausing. On the next floor, you repeat the process. Do note, however, that if you pause too quickly, before the level has started to load/fade in, you miss the chance to pause and must wait until it is fully loaded in. Not a big deal if it happens rarely, but something to be aware of. That's why I say that the timing is crucial here, and is something users must get a feel for.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Perhaps this was too 'texty' and can be shortened down, but it's an advanced technique and not easy to explain briefly so that people get the whole gist of it. That's why I would recommend to refer to that video (or others if they exist) so people can see it in action, as well as get it explained by probably the best person in the world at this particular technique. <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 10:06, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>What about: "While time still passes as levels in the skull cavern fade in and out, opening the inventory at the right point can pause time during these fade screens. However, this can be quite precise." And then insert a link? <a href="../User_Atravita.html?title=User:Atravita&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Atravita (page does not exist)">Atravita</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Atravita.html" title="User talk:Atravita">talk</a>) 12:29, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Oh goodness, so we're talking about two techniques here: (1) stopping time during the loading process, and (2) clicking both mouse buttons to place a staircase during the time-pause. I did <i>not</i> get that we were demonstrating the time-pause strategy from the video, I got that the creator was using the time pause to do some bonus work (<i>i.e.,</i> placing a staircase). So now we've added another layer of complexity. That's a bit too advanced to be really useful, I think. It falls in the same category as animation cancelling, something the wiki doesn't go into because it's tricky and not all that helpful to the majority of casual players. It seems to apply only to mouse/keyboard as well, there's no mention of using a controller. I think it's really something for reddit, discord, the forums, youtube, twitch, etc. but not so much for the wiki.</dd>
<dd>I will say this again, though, if the video creator (or anyone else) can create a clear, concise instructional video, I have no problem providing a very brief summary of the strat and then linking to the video (with appropriate disclaimers that the technique may be difficult). We're just not there yet, not with the video we have been referring to in our discussion. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 22:12, 8 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Sorry to hear that&#160;:( Like I said earlier, it's not easy to explain this in a short sentence or two, because it involves several tiny steps. That's why it is better to see it in action, so people can easier connect the words to actions and consequences. I hoped to get this information onto the wiki so others can try their hand at it too, but I understand if it is deemed as too "heavy".</dd>
<dd>As an aside, I have never tried animation cancelling, and don't see how that has much value outside of actual speedruns, which from what I understand are measured on real-time instead of in-game time. Because animation basically stops the in-game clock anyway (e.g., NPCs and the clock stop), so normal playing doesn't have much if any benefit I think? I look at this stairs technique differently, because all the tools for it are there in a vanilla game, no need for external programs or macros or whatever. The short of it is you hit pause on floor load, hold down mouse buttons on unpause, and down you go. It does work on other platforms too btw, but apparently not as well as on PC, because it can be more tricky to place stairs quickly on other platforms. Don't have personal experience with that, because I only have the game on PC, but others on the forum said as much.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps you have made up your mind to not include it, but here is a different and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="../../external.html?link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkBpk2kqd1w">shorter video</a> about the technique. Personally I think Godzilla explained it better, but maybe this is more fitting anyway? In any case, if it isn't included here, I hope other players are able to stumble across it on the forum or other places it may be discussed. Going that deep has been a lot of fun for me, and breathed new life into the game with a new type of challenge. I merely wanted others to have the same chance, and figured the wiki has a lot more eyes on it than the forum or very specific threads on reddit. <a href="../User_Pangaea.html" title="User:Pangaea">Pangaea</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Pangaea.html" title="User talk:Pangaea">talk</a>) 08:08, 9 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi Margotbean, I've only been here for half a year. I noticed that a few fish, when used in the Maki Roll, are profitable, even if you buy the rice. Where do you think I should put this- just on the Maki Roll page, or on both the Maki Roll page and the fish page?
If I don't respond immediately, it's because either I'm still sleeping, I haven't checked my mail, or I'm busy.
Have a good day! (For the next day) <a href="../User_Jxy31.html" title="User:Jxy31">Jxy31</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Jxy31.html?title=User_talk:Jxy31&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jxy31 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:40, 3 September 2022 (UTC)

</p>
<dl><dd>Hello Jxy31, the normal place to put profitability info is on the <a href="../Maki_Roll.html" title="Maki Roll">Maki Roll</a> page and under <a href="../Cooking.html#Profitable_Recipes" title="Cooking">Cooking#Profitable Recipes</a>. (See the <a href="../Bread.html" title="Bread">Bread</a> page for example.) Are you sure the recipe is profitable, though? If you purchase <a href="../Rice.html" title="Rice">rice</a> at Pierre's, you pay <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="200"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" src="../mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" />200g</span>, and the lowest selling fish is the periwinkle at <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="20"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" src="../mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" />20g</span>, which makes you break even. (If you factor in seaweed at <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="20"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" src="../mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" />20g</span>, you actually lose money.) I think you need to say the recipe is profitable when using rice from the mill, and fish worth <span style="display: none;">data-sort-value="100"&gt;</span><span class="no-wrap"><img alt="Gold.png" src="../mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/18px-Gold.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="/mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/27px-Gold.png 1.5x, /mediawiki/images/thumb/1/10/Gold.png/36px-Gold.png 2x" />100g</span> or less. (220g - 20g for seaweed - 100g for rice). Am I looking at this wrong? <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 19:27, 3 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Yes, that makes sense. At this point, my logic is: Rice costs 200 g, Maki Roll sells for 220 g, Rice sells for 100 g, Seaweed sells 20 g apiece, any fish that sells for less than 100 g is barely profitable. You need to start with a lot of fish, seaweed, and at least 200 g for this plan to work. Should I bring this up? <a href="../User_Jxy31.html" title="User:Jxy31">Jxy31</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Jxy31.html?title=User_talk:Jxy31&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Jxy31 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 00:44, 4 September 2022 (UTC) If you don't understand, don't worry, it's complicated and BARELY worth it and probably not worth the time.
<dl><dd>I didn't realize it was a plan, simply a statement about profitability. Players are absolutely obsessed with min/maxing this game, so I think it's worth noting a profitable recipe, even if it has conditions (like using rice from the Mill and fish worth less than 100g). <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:57, 4 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Definitely better to keep editing open to the public, but seems a nuisance that people keep trying to make the same changes every few weeks.</dd>
<dd>It'd be like a template within a template, like {{friendsOf {{PAGENAME}}}} in Template:Infobox_villager</dd>

<dl><dd>In the interest of "other options", I offer the following.</dd>
<dd>What about "Friends who give gift advice?" This would actually change it to be the advice givers rather than the people about whom advice is given, but isn't that actually more useful? I would be more likely to wonder (on Jodi's page, say), "Where can I find gift advice about Jodi?" than I am to wonder, "Who does Jodi give gift advice about?"</dd>
<dd>Do family members always give gift advice about each other? If so, perhaps the Family and Friends sections could be merged into "Gift advice from:". You could still leave the labels for family members and add the (Friend) label for everyone else.</dd>
<dd>I realize both of these proposals would result in Clint being on Emily's page. That was not what I set out to do. But ultimately, I want to make the Wiki as useful as possible and as easy to maintain as possible. I think ease of maintenance would happen no matter which "direction" you went, but reversing the direction makes it more useful (to the extent that knowing this is useful in the first place).</dd>
<dd>Of course, you could leave the "direction" the way it is with only a small modification to the changes I suggested. <a href="../User_Zendowolf.html" title="User:Zendowolf">Zendowolf</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Zendowolf.html" title="User talk:Zendowolf">talk</a>) 11:00, 27 September 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The game code reads from index 9 of <samp>NPCDispositions.xnb</samp>. The field lists all family members and their relationship to the NPC. It also lists some non-family, with a blank space for relationship. In certain cases, the love interest (index 6) isn't listed in index 9, indicating the two people are friends, but give no gifting hints about each other (<i>e.g.,</i> Alex &amp; Haley, Elliott &amp; Leah).</dd>
<dd>What I suggested earlier was basically "Friends who give gifting advice"... It's too long for an Infobox heading. "Gift advice from:" is better, but still requires translation into 11 other languages. We'd also be losing friendship info that isn't in index 9 of <samp>NPCDispositions.xnb</samp>. As I mentioned before, Leo &amp; Linus are pretty objectively friends, as are Emily &amp; Sandy, but none of that is listed in the data file. <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:14, 27 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Crab_Pot_Numbers">Crab_Pot Numbers</span></h2>
<p>Hey Margotbean, 
</p><p>I'm relatively new to Stardew Valley, but I've had heaps of fun going through the wiki and the corresponding code in the decompiled game code, my hobby in game is fishing. I was looking at just how good crab pots are, running the numbers, using the data provided in the wiki, and noticed a few inconsistencies and things missing I felt could add depth. 
</p><p>First - I think the numbers on the crab pot page, 'Gold Per Day' section, are incorrect. Only by a little (in the case of the freshwater figure, it's by a decimal amount), but incorrect. 
</p><p>Second - I think the page would do very well to expand on the intricacies of whether or not someone is a fisher, angler, and or turning low worth fish into sashimi. As it stands, the section implies mariners profit far more from crab pots, but fishers and anglers can do very well for themselves with them as well. I haven't done the math on how mariner affects earnings, but the math is relatively straightforward so I assume it's correct. But I wonder whether a table would do well in the section, something like 
</p>
<table class="wikitable">
<caption>Ocean Gold Per Day
</caption>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Skill(s)</th>
<th>No cooking</th>
<th>Cooking
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>None</td>
<td>49.77</td>
<td>62.17
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fisher</td>
<td>57.59</td>
<td>65.27
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Angler</td>
<td>65.41</td>
<td>69.85
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Mariner</td>
<td>???</td>
<td>81.4
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Let me know what you think. I'd be happy to run the numbers on the mariner profession as well to find the Gold/Day without sashimi.
</p><p>Edit: I'm just now realising I should've posted this in the 'Talk: Crab Pot' page itself. Sorry about that, I'm a bit green with all this and it seemed logical to me to post this here as you're across the Crab Pot talk.
Edit(2): I have no idea how communicating through this wiki actually works, as far as I can tell you can't even see my ID, for what it's worth my profile is <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="../User_Robo.html">https://stardewvalleywiki.com/User:Robo</a>

<dl><dd>Hello Robo, and welcome to the wiki! To sign your posts (so I know who you are), just type four tildes at the end of your post. The wiki will automatically convert that into a proper signature once you save (or preview) the page.</dd>
<dd>I appreciate the amount of work you've put into this, but the bottom line is that it's a trivia item on the page, and even under the best circumstances, the gold per day isn't mind-blowing. Given that, I don't think expanding the section in great length is warranted. You should definitely make any corrections you feel are right, and explain them on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>Having said that, a table like the one you've created above instead of text would be fine, but all the calculations that went into it have to be explained on the talk page. ...Preferably in as concise, succinct, and short a manner as possible.</dd>
<dd>That brings us to the next problem: as a new user, you can't post external links. A link to a google doc would be far preferable to a screenshot of a spreadsheet. People want to be able to examine the cells for the underlying calculations. So, if you have posted the info to a google drive, I highly recommend linking to it, rather than reproducing it all on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>If you try to post a link, you'll get an error message, but I'll be able to see the link in the spam log, and I can add it to the page.</dd>
<dd>I hope this answers your question(s)! A bit of "yes" and a bit of "no, not so much, just a summary instead". Thanks, and please let me know if anything I've said has been unclear! <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 18:40, 29 September 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hello.

</p>
<dl><dd>Hello Equo! If it's important to you, then you can upload the image as a new version of the existing image. If you don't see any change in the image, wait up to 5 hours for the server to refresh. (I've repeatedly asked the server people to fix this wait time, but to no avail!) If you do see your image, then great! The wiki doesn't recompress .png images, but PNGGauntlet may cause issues with transparency. Wait until you see your new image properly, and then assess the transparency. If it looks good, you're done. If not... get back to me. I can try to compress it in Photoshop with 8-bit depth.

<h2><span id="Catfish/Bundles"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Catfish.2FBundles">Catfish/Bundles</span></h2>
<p>Hey, just following up on some changes that were made on the Catfish and Bundles page regarding Winter availability for the Catfish. <a href="../User_Spiderkace.html" title="User:Spiderkace">Spiderkace</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Spiderkace.html" title="User talk:Spiderkace">talk</a>) 23:15, 7 November 2022 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello Spiderkace! What's your question? <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 01:19, 8 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Not so much a question but just looking to discuss the changes. Game code indicates Catfish is available in Winter in Rivers and Farm Maps Spring, Fall, and Winter while raining. It is also available in Summer/Winter in the Secret Woods while Raining. I guess the piece I'm getting hung up on besides grammar or formatting in which, obviously you would have the final say, is the Witch's Hut which is available during all seasons regardless of weather (as it's "indoors") and a Rain Totem wouldn't be needed. Would it be better to just exclude the Witch's Hut from the Bundles page (as the Community Center has likely been completed by this point and/or a Catfish probably has been caught before the Witch's Hut)? I was trying to get around this with phrasing the topic slightly differently than the other fish given its... unique situations. I suppose this also applies to the <a href="../Catfish.html" title="Catfish">Catfish</a> page itself, not just <a href="../Bundles.html" title="Bundles">Bundles</a>. <br /> <br /> Also, is there a reason the Bundles page doesn't have a TOC?&#160;::<a href="../User_Spiderkace.html" title="User:Spiderkace">Spiderkace</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Spiderkace.html" title="User talk:Spiderkace">talk</a>) 14:05, 8 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Do we know if indoor areas ignore the location context's weather? Cuz in my reading, it doesn't. <a href="../User_Atravita.html?title=User:Atravita&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Atravita (page does not exist)">Atravita</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Atravita.html" title="User talk:Atravita">talk</a>) 14:46, 8 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>That is the question! No one should be changing the wiki until we have confirmed the information in-game (by stepping through the code or otherwise). Right now, I don't know if the Witch's Swamp follows weather outside for the purposes of fishing. I also haven't thoroughly tested the alternate farms' maps for fishing.</dd>
<dd>As we've seen before, reading the code itself can be misleading. Values can be assigned and never used. Values also get assigned, and then changed at the last minute in unexpected places (such as when drawing the popup dialog box).</dd>
<dd>So, we need to proceed with caution here.</dd>
<dd>The Bundles page has a TOC, it's at the top right of the page.&#160;;) <a href="../User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:09, 8 November 2022 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Disregard Bundles TOC, I'm blind.</dd>
<dd>If the code isn't to be trusted, what is? If the code indicates one thing, and the game displays another, is that not a bug versus incorrect information? I'm cross-referencing data from Data\Locations, Data\Fish, and the game code at Farm.cs. I can understand the interior locations conundrum, but I'm only going down this rabbit hole because I found (what I thought) was missing or incorrect information with Sunfish locations, where two wiki pages stated one thing but a third indicated something else, which made me dig into the game code to find out what was really going on. Say the word and I'll stop but I'm spending a lot of time trying to find the correct information via the source itself.</dd>
<dd>Also, what did you mean about the map for Carp? Carp is correctly showing the Mountain Lake, are you saying it's not showing Bug Lair, Sewers, and Secret Woods as well? What is the limit for the map? Where is the map pulling its information from? What if we could do something like making a .png manually instead of pulling from wherever it pulls now to keep consistency with the other pages? <a href="../User_Spiderkace.html" title="User:Spiderkace">Spiderkace</a> (<a href="../User_talk_Spiderkace.html" title="User talk:Spiderkace">talk</a>) 18:46, 8 November 2022 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I pressed it a few more time and nothing. But when I held down “x” it rapidly shook and after about 2-3 seconds it just popped out of the ground.
