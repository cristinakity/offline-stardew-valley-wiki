</td></tr>

</td>

Fences are useful for keeping <a href="Weeds.html" title="Weeds">weeds</a> at bay and protecting your <a href="Crops.html" title="Crops">crops</a>. They also let farmers contain their <a href="Animals.html" title="Animals">livestock</a>.

Placing a <a href="Scarecrow.html" title="Scarecrow">scarecrow</a> on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops!<br>One more thing... need a bigger <a href="Tools.html#Other_Tools" title="Tools">backpack</a> to hold all your stuff?

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>18 Spring, Year 1
</td>
<td>Ah, refreshing <a href="Weather.html" title="Weather">rain</a>... a Farmer's best friend! When it rains, you don't have to water your crops. Use this to your advantage!
</td></tr>

The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of <a href="Fish.html" title="Fish">fish</a> you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather!
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>25 Spring, Year 1
</td>
<td><a href="Fruit_Trees.html" title="Fruit Trees">Fruit trees</a>. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!
</td></tr>

<td>1 Summer, Year 1
</td>
<td><a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a>'s here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take <a href="Hops.html" title="Hops">hops</a>, for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck!

And <a href="Octopus.html" title="Octopus">Octopus</a>, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!
</td></tr>

</td>
<td>Let's talk <a href="Corn.html" title="Corn">corn</a>. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both <a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">summer</a> and <a href="Fall.html" title="Fall">fall</a>. Now, get out there and plant some corn!

<tr>
<td>11 Summer, Year 1
</td>
<td>Starting tomorrow, an unusual amount of <a href="Foraging.html#The_Beach" title="Foraging">shells and corals</a> are expected to wash up on beaches all around the world. I'm no scientist, but I've heard it's something to do with crab mating season. At any rate, you could make some good coin combing your local beach.

If you know how to craft a <a href="Lightning_Rod.html" title="Lightning Rod">lightning rod</a>, you can harvest the electricity and create <a href="Battery_Pack.html" title="Battery Pack">battery packs</a>. These can be sold or used for <a href="Crafting.html" title="Crafting">crafting</a>!
</td></tr>
<tr>

</td>
<td>Most towns have a seasonal <a href="Calendar.html" title="Calendar">calendar</a> in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well!
</td></tr>

</td>
<td><a href="Fall.html" title="Fall">Fall</a>'s almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new <a href="Crops.html" title="Crops">seeds</a>. If you haven't upgraded your <a href="Watering_Cans.html" title="Watering Cans">watering can</a> by now, it's probably a good idea.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1 Fall, Year 1
</td>
<td>Let's talk <a href="Sunflower.html" title="Sunflower">sunflowers</a>. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some <a href="Sunflower_Seeds.html" title="Sunflower Seeds">seeds</a> as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!

</td></tr>

</td>
<td>Fish Focus: <a href="Salmon.html" title="Salmon">Salmon</a>. Salmon return to their spawning ground in fall to lay eggs. That means the rivers are chock-full of them! You can only find them in fall, so get out there and cast your pole.
</td></tr>

Make sure you're prepared to feed your <a href="Animal.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Animal">animals</a> <a href="Hay.html" title="Hay">hay</a> over the winter, because they don't like going outside in the cold. Also, your <a href="Grass.html" title="Grass">grass</a> won't keep growing after that first frost.
