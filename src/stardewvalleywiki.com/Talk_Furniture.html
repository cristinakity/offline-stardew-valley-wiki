<dl><dd>It is an item that exists in the game's data files, but was never actually implemented into the game. The only way to get it is through mods.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Page_Revamp">Page Revamp</span></h2>
<p>I'm like to propose standardizing the Furniture page, particularly the wikitables. My suggestion is that each table (with a few exceptions such as "Night Market Paintings", "Movie Posters", "Seasonal Plants", etc) should have the following columns: "Carpenter's Shop", "Traveling Cart", "Furniture Catalogue", and "Other". The "Other" column would include the Oasis, the Casino, the Desert Trader, the Island Trader, Festivals, events, items unique to certain farms, etc. I think a standardization like that would remove the need for most of the information above each table, and it would help clear up some confusing listings. I'd also like to find a way to show all of the Wall Sconce options in the "Lamps &amp; Windows" section. I'm willing to tackle this myself over the next few weeks, but I'd like to open it up to discussion first. Thanks <a href="User_Digresser.html?title=User:Digresser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Digresser (page does not exist)">Digresser</a> (<a href="User_talk_Digresser.html?title=User_talk:Digresser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Digresser (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:06, 16 July 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello Digresser! That sounds like a fine idea to reduce the number of columns in some tables. The fact that you said it would take "a few weeks" does concern me a bit... are you planning on updating all 12 languages? If so, that would be stupendous!!</dd>
<dd>Why don't you create the changes in your user space (create a page called "User:Digresser/FurnitureRedo" or somthing similar), and work on it there when you have time. That way, you can work out any problems or bugs before the changes go live, and you can also work at your leisure. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 14:06, 16 July 2023 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Sure, I can do it that way if you'd like. The reason I said "a few weeks" is because I don't have much time available to me, and I was planning on tackling one or two sections whenever I had an hour to spare. <a href="User_Digresser.html?title=User:Digresser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Digresser (page does not exist)">Digresser</a> (<a href="User_talk_Digresser.html?title=User_talk:Digresser&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Digresser (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 03:50, 17 July 2023 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Furniture_Template_Update">Furniture Template Update</span></h2>
<p>I'd like to suggest 2 updates to furniture tables and the furniture article infobox template:
</p>
<ol><li><b>Include furniture size</b> (tile area, e.g., 2x3, 1x1; include for floor/tabletop <i>and</i> wall items)</li>
<li><b>Include placement behavior</b> (e.g., floor, wall, outside/inside, tabletop)</li></ol>
<p>This information would be especially helpful for players who have yet to buy the furniture catalogue, as it will help them determine if they have the necessary/desired free space to place an individual item before purchasing it.
</p><p><i>Please note: I've only played Stardew Valley on mobile (iOS) so far, so am unsure if this information is included in purchase screens on other platforms. It is certainly missing in iOS, though.</i>

</p>
<dl><dd><i><b>"Allwall hangings available in the Furniture Catalogue can not also be purchased from the Traveling Cart."</b></i></dd></dl>
<p>However, according to each furniture pages, some Wall Hangings (for example, <a href="Wallflower_Pal.html" title="Wallflower Pal">Wallflower Pal</a> or <a href="Skull_Poster.html" title="Skull Poster">Skull Poster</a>) can be obtained from both of <a href="Traveling_Cart.html" title="Traveling Cart">Traveling Cart</a> and Furniture Catalogue. Others (for example <a href="Calendar.html" title="Calendar">Calendar</a> or <a href="Decorative_Axe.html" title="Decorative Axe">Decorative Axe</a>) can be obtained only from Furniture Catalogue and Traveling Cart would never sell them.
</p><p>So I think we have to make consistency on this conflict, but I have no idea which is true (each furniture pages or this Furniture page).
</p><p>Does anyone know about it or have proper explanation for it?

</p>
<dl><dd>At this point I don't know how this inconsistency came to be exactly... but I'm guessing that at some point it was true that no wall hangings (the ones listed on the <a href="Furniture.html" title="Furniture">Furniture</a> page, anyway) could be purchased at the <a href="Traveling_Cart.html" title="Traveling Cart">Traveling Cart</a>. The game code specifies a block of numbers that correspond to furniture items, and that block didn't change, so I thought "Great, no changes!" But if new furniture items were added into the middle of that block of numbers... well, then it's a problem for the wiki.</dd>
<dd>Someone will need to check the code to see which items can show up in the Traveling Cart; until then, perhaps we simply remove from the <a href="Furniture.html" title="Furniture">Furniture</a> page any statement about the Traveling Cart (for wall hangings). Someday I may be able to test the code (and in-game) to get to the bottom of it. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 17:32, 15 December 2024 (UTC)</dd></dl>

The second issue is with the user experience - it is really hard to tell at a glance which items are available from a catalogue and which aren't. All in all, it eems like the tables are prioritizing space efficiency over user experience.
</p><p>So, I decided to remake it, and you can see my finished result <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mediawiki/indexf8fd.html?title=Furniture&amp;oldid=183857">here</a>. I didn't know that I was supposed to discuss large formatting changes before making them, so it was reverted 10 hours later. So, this is the discussion thread I was supposed to make. If this is accepted, please revert the deletion of the varius icons I uploaded as well. <a href="User_Myirlname.html?title=User:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Myirlname (page does not exist)">Myirlname</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myirlname.html?title=User_talk:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Myirlname (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 23:17, 23 January 2025 (UTC)

<dl><dd>On this page, most of the categorical statements about furniture being available from the traveling cart are wrong, so it's best to individually specify which are availble. I've also updated my revamp and you can see it [[User:Myirlname/sandbox/Furniture|here]]. <a href="User_Myirlname.html?title=User:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Myirlname (page does not exist)">Myirlname</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myirlname.html?title=User_talk:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Myirlname (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 08:22, 1 February 2025 (UTC)
<dl><dd>The formatting on the sandbox page isn't better, it's just different. Both ways of formatting have issues and problems, so we're going to leave it as is. The icons are not coming back, so it would be best if the missing image errors on the page were resolved in any case. If anyone has specific information about what items can be placed outside or what items are sold at the 1.6 Traveling Cart, they can add that information to the existing page. Ideally someone would look at the underlying code, and not add one-offs that they experienced in-game. <a href="User_Margotbean.html" title="User:Margotbean">margotbean</a> (<a href="User_talk_Margotbean.html" title="User talk:Margotbean">talk</a>) 13:56, 1 February 2025 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I'll need more information as to the problems of my design, I'll see if I can improve it. I did look at the underlying code as to what furniture can be bought from the traveling cart, but I didn't look into what can be placed outside. Also, why exactly are the icons "not coming back"? <a href="User_Myirlname.html?title=User:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Myirlname (page does not exist)">Myirlname</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myirlname.html?title=User_talk:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Myirlname (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:10, 1 February 2025 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Oh, and while I have your attention, I've posted a topic on <a href="Talk_Stardew_Valley_Wiki.html#Wiki_discord_server" title="Talk:Stardew Valley Wiki">Talk:Stardew Valley Wiki</a> suggesting a wiki discord server since from my experience, communication between editors is better that way, at least much better than talk pages. Please consider it. <a href="User_Myirlname.html?title=User:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Myirlname (page does not exist)">Myirlname</a> (<a href="User_talk_Myirlname.html?title=User_talk:Myirlname&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:Myirlname (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 16:19, 1 February 2025 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
