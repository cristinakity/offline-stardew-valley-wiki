<h3 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Key">Key</span></h3>
<p>Each mail entry has a unique key which identifies the message (<i>e.g.,</i> to track whether the player already received it). For example, <samp>Robin</samp> at the start of this entry is the mail key:
</p>
<div class="mw-highlight mw-highlight-lang-json mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr"><pre><span></span><span class="s2">"Robin"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"Hey there!^I had some extra wood lying around... I thought maybe you could use it. Take care!  ^   -Robin %item object 388 50 %%[#]A Gift From Robin"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The key can be one of these formats:
</p>
<table class="wikitable">

<tbody><tr>
<th>syntax
</th>
<th>description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><samp><code title="required field 'season'">&lt;season&gt;</code>_<code title="required field 'day of month'">&lt;day of month&gt;</code>_<code title="required field 'year'">&lt;year&gt;</code></samp>

<td><i>arbitrary key</i>
</td>
<td>Anything else is just a unique letter ID, which can be sent in code or via <a href="Modding_Event_data.html" title="Modding:Event data">an event script</a>.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>It's not recommended to use the date-based format for compatibility reasons, because if multiple mods add mail with the same key only one will get sent. If you need your mail to be sent on a specific date, see <a href="Modding_Trigger_actions.html" title="Modding:Trigger actions">trigger actions</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="in-block"><span class="mw-headline" id="Value">Value</span></h3>
<p>The value for each letter entry has this format: <code title="required field 'letter text'">&lt;letter text&gt;</code>[#]<code title="required field 'letter name'">&lt;letter name&gt;</code>.
</p><p>The <code title="required field 'letter name'">&lt;letter name&gt;</code> field is just a unique human-readable name for the letter, shown in the mail collections tab.
</p><p>The <code title="required field 'letter text'">&lt;letter text&gt;</code> field is the text to show when the player opens the letter. This recognizes some special tokens:
</p>

<p>The game tracks <i>mail flags</i> for each player. This is used for two purposes:
</p>
<ul><li>Tracking received letters. The key for each letter in <samp>Data\Mail</samp> is a mail flag; if the player has the flag for a letter, the game considers it to be received.</li>
<li>Tracking non-mail changes in the world. For example, <samp>artifactFound</samp> means the player has found at least one artifact, <samp>jojaMember</samp> means the player has a Joja membership, etc. These have no letter associated with them.</li></ul>
<p>You can check the mail flags in-game:
